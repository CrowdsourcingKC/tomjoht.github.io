  title: "Tech Comm Trends: Providing value as a generalist in a sea of specialists"
  notes: "Title slide."

- slide: 1
  title: Why trends intrigue us
  notes: We want to avoid waking up and finding that we have become obsolete.

- slide: 2
  title: "The impact of UX and the need for docs"
  notes: "Jim Grey's controversial argument that tech writers are dying out, being replaced by UX writers."

- slide: 3
  title: "An 'evolution of roles,' but towards what?"
  notes: "Pratt: 'I think there is a truth in saying that the role of the technical author is changing, and the requirements and the skills that they need are changing as well.'"

- slide: 4
  title: "BLS data about TW and SD job growth"
  notes: "From 2012 to 2017, TW had 8.2% growth, growing from 46.2k to 50k. Software developers and programmers had 15.7% growth, growing from 1.4 million to 1.6 million."

- slide: 5
  title: "BLS data about TW and SD job growth"
  notes: "BLS says 'Job opportunities, especially for applicants with technical skills, are expected to be good.' <br>What this means: -->1 tech writer for every 33 software developers and programmers in 2016. <br>--> 1 tech writer for every 35 software developers and programmers in 2026. <br>'The number of engineers I support seems to be growing each year, making the ratio of tech writers to engineers more lopsided (with fewer tech writers and more engineers).'"

- slide: 6
  title: "Common questions and objections"
  notes: "How consistent is BLS’s collection methodology from year to year? <br>Are job titles in tech comm too diverse to measure? <br>Are more tech writers being hired offshore (excluded from BLS)?<br>Has user-generated content reduced the need for tech writers?"


- slide: 7
  title: "Trends trajectories"
  notes: "pdf to web, XML & semantic web, wikis, DITA, social media, content strategy, YouTube and video, chatbots, docs as code, augmented reality, internet of things, AI"

- slide: 8
  title: "A reliable barometer for trends: job ads"
  notes:  "TC job categories: 22% Content Dev/Mgr., 10% Grant/Propos. Writer, 4%  Medical Writer, 11% Social Media Mgr, 52% Tech writer/editor. Desired professional competencies (tw/e): 75% Written communication, 51% Editing, 49% Project planning/mgmt, 49% Visual communication, 45% Subject-matter familiarity, 41% Working with SMEs, 40% Style guides/standards"

- slide: 9
  title: "Subject-matter familiarity a constant requirement"
  notes: "Scope: 2 years or less of experience. Desired professional competencies: 33% Subject matter experience, 34% Subject matter writing experience, 26% Subject matter knowledge, 17% TW-specific skills"

- slide: 10
  title: "Candidate should know [X] technology already"
  notes: "Subject matter familiarity is a key requirement in a lot of the tech comm jobs I've looked at. It seems employers often want me to know X, Y, and Z technologies already from the start."

- slide: 11
  title: "Tech knowledge seems to beat writing skills"
  notes: "Strong technical skills beat candidates with mediocre tech skills, even if the reverse isn't true with writing skills. As a result, candidates with strong writing skills look to hybridize their job titles. <br> Technical writer/editor, Technical writer/content strategist, Technical writer/information architect, Technical writer/project manager, Technical writer/information designer. <br>In hiring, it's easier to check boxes for technical skills rather than evaluate writing capabilities. Which is easier to test for in hiring?"

- slide: 12
  title: "Some companies only hire developers who write"
  notes: "Writer shares linkedin note re being fired in favor of a developer writer."

- slide: 13
  title: "Future: The 'Technical Technical Writer' wins the job"
  notes: "The future is the Technical Technical Writer who knows lots of programming languages or technical frameworks. There's a growing divide between these writers and other less-technical writers."

- slide: 14
  title: "Why? Is tech getting simpler, or more complex?"
  notes: "Tech has moved from single vendor systems to multiple vendor systems. JS frameworks have exploded. APIs interact with other APIs in ways no one tests."

- slide: 15
  title: "How do you learn the needed technical skills?"
  notes: "How much time do you actually devote to learning technology each day? 30 min. or less."

- slide: 16
  title: "Constant learning creates a plastic mind"
  notes: "Brains change when we learn regularly. The mindset is more important than what we soak in."

- slide: 17
  title: "Companies don’t always know what they need"
  notes: "There’s a disconnect between what companies say they want and what they actually need. They say they want technical technical writers, but what they really want is to improve the customer experience. The 'technical technical' writer isn’t necessarily going to do that. - Paul Gustovson, Expert Support"

- slide: 18
  title: In the long run, the writer who focuses on CX wins
  notes: "There's a disconnect between what companies say they want and what they actually need. They say they want technical technical writers, but what they really want is to improve the customer experience. The 'technical technical' writer isn’t necessarily going to do that. - Paul Gustovson, Expert Support. <br>'If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.' ~ Henry Ford <br>'A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.' - Steve Jobs. <br>CX questions to answer: <br>1. What's the CX journey with our products? <br>2. What's the CX on competitor products? <br>3. What are the pain points in our CX? <br>4. What CX can we infer from web analytics? 5. What CX insights do we get from surveys? <br>6. What are people saying/writing about our products? <br>7. How can docs improve the CX?"

- slide: 19
  title: "Agree? Disagree? Let’s find out."
  notes: "Survey at idratherbewriting.site/tsurvey. Take a short survey to find out how much you all agree or disagree. See ongoing results at idratherbewriting.site/tresults."
