During this workshop, we explored the following:

* Using a REST API as a developer
* Documenting a new API endpoint
* Documenting non-reference sections
* Exploring other REST APIs
* Publishing API docs
* Design patterns
* Documenting native library APIs

You learned new tools and technologies, ways to publish and create interactive experiences for your audience. Now as you go forward into API documentation, hopefully you have a solid foundation to start.
