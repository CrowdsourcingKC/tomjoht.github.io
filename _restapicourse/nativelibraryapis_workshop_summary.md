During this course, we explored the following:

* Using a REST API as a developer
* Documenting a new API endpoint
* Documenting non-reference sections
* Exploring other REST APIs
* Publishing API docs
* Design patterns

You learned new tools and technologies, ways to publish and create interactive experiences for your audience. Now as you go forward into API documentation, hopefully you have a solid foundation to start.
