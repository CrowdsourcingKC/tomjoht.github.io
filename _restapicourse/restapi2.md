## Complete and accurate docs are most important factor in APIs

In a [2013 survey by Programmableweb.com](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/api-consumers-want-reliability-documentation-and-community/2013/01/07), about 250 developers were asked to rank the most important factors in an API. "Complete and accurate documentation" ranked as #1.

John Musser, one of the founders of Programmableweb.com, has followed up on the importance of good API documentation in some of his presentations. In "10 reasons why developers hate your API," he named Reason #1 as "Your documentation sucks."

## REST APIs are taking off in a huge way

If REST APIs were an uncommon software product, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. But actually, REST APIs, or more generally web APIs, are taking off in a huge way. Through the PEW Research Center, Programmableweb.com has charted and tracked the prevalance of web APIs.

eBay's API in 2005 was one of the first web APIs. Since then, the tremendous growth in web APIs coupled with "complete and accurate" documentation as the number most important factor with APIs presents a perfect opportunity for technical writers. Technical writers can apply their skills in solving problems faced by developer communities in a market that's exploding.

## Job market is hot for API technical writers
Many employers are looking to hire technical writers who can create not only complete and accurate documentation, but who can also create stylish outputs.

This is because with API documentation, there is no GUI interface for users to browse. For the most part, the documentation *is* the interface that users navigate as they use the API. Employers know this, so they want to make sure they have the right resources to make their API docs stand out as much as possible.

Here's what the Dropbox API looks like:

It's not a sophisticated design. Its simplicity and brevity is one of its strengths.

## API doc is a new world

Unfortunately, API documentation is mostly a new world to technical writers. Everything about it is foreign: 

* Authoring tools
* Developer audience
* Programming languages
* Division of content into reference and tutorials
* Ways the product is used

When you set about in API documentation, the world looks as unfamiliar as Mars:

## Increasing learning materials about API documentation

Realizing there was a need for more information, I proposed that the STC focus more attention on API documentation. I guest-edited a special issue of Intercom dedicated to API documentation.

This issue was a good start, but many technical writers have asked for more training. In our Silicon Valley STC chapter, we've held a couple of workshops dedicated to APIs. Both workshops sold out quickly (with 60 participants in the first, and 100 participants in the second). 

This year, the STC Summit is holding its first ever API documentation track.

Technical writers are hungry to learn more about APIs. To help address this ongoing need, I've created this course to teach technical writers about API documentation.
