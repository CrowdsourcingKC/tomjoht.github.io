## Complete and accurate docs are most important factor in APIs

In a [2013 survey by Programmableweb.com](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/api-consumers-want-reliability-documentation-and-community/2013/01/07), about 250 developers were asked to rank the most important factors in an API. "Complete and accurate documentation" ranked as #1.

John Musser, one of the founders of Programmableweb.com, has followed up on the importance of good API documentation in some of his presentations. In "10 reasons why developers hate your API," he says the number one reason developers hate your API is becuase "Your documentation sucks."

## REST APIs are taking off in a huge way

If REST APIs were an uncommon software product, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. But actually, REST APIs, or more generally web APIs, are taking off in a huge way. Through the PEW Research Center, Programmableweb.com has charted and tracked the prevalance of web APIs.

eBay's API in 2005 was one of the first web APIs. Since then, the tremendous growth in web APIs coupled with "complete and accurate" documentation as the number most important factor with APIs, presents a perfect opportunity for technical writers. Technical writers can apply their communication skills to fill a gap in a market that is exploding.

## Job market is hot for API technical writers
Many employers are looking to hire technical writers who can create not only complete and accurate documentation, but who can also create stylish outputs. Here's a recent job posting from a recruiter looking for someone who can emulate Dropbox's documentation.

Why does the look and feel of the documentation matter so much? With API documentation, there is no GUI interface for users to browse. For the most part, the documentation *is* the interface. Employers know this, so they want to make sure they have the right resources to make their API docs stand out as much as possible.

Here's what the Dropbox API looks like:

It's not a sophisticated design. But its simplicity and brevity is one of its strengths.

## API doc is a new world

Unfortunately, API documentation is mostly a new world to technical writers. All the components may seem foreign: 

* Authoring tools
* Developer audience
* Programming languages
* Division of content into reference and tutorials
* Ways the product is used

When you try to navigate the world of API documentation, the world looks as unfamiliar as Mars:

## Increasing learning materials about API documentation

Realizing there was a need for more information, I guest-edited a special issue of Intercom dedicated to API documentation.

<a href="http://bit.ly/stcintercomapiissue"><img src="{{ "/images/restapicourse/intercom.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="STC Intercom issue focused on API documentation" /></a> 

This issue was a good start, but many technical writers have asked for more training. In our Silicon Valley STC chapter, we've held a couple of workshops dedicated to APIs. Both workshops sold out quickly (with 60 participants in the first, and 100 participants in the second). 

This year, the STC Summit is holding its first ever API documentation track.

Technical writers are hungry to learn more about APIs. To help address this ongoing need, I've created this course to teach technical writers about API documentation.
