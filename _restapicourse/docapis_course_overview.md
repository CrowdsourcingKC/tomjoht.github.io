## Documenting REST APIs course

Welcome to my course on writing documentation for REST APIs. In this course, instead of just talking about abstract concepts, I'm going to contextualize REST APIs with a direct, hands-on approach. 

You'll learn about API documentation in the context of using some simple weather APIs to put a weather forecast on your site.

As you use the API, you learn about endpoints, parameters, data types, authentication, cURL, JSON, the command line, Chrome's Developer Console, JavaScript, and other details associated with REST APIs. 

The point is that, rather than learning about these concepts independent of any context, you learn them by immersing yourself in a real scenario while using an API.

After you use the API as a developer, you'll then shift perspectives and become a technical writer tasked with documenting a new endpoint that has been added to the API.

As a technical writer, you'll tackle each element of a reference topic in REST API documentation: 

* Resource descriptions
* Endpoint definitions and methods
* Parameters
* Sample requests
* Sample responses
* Error codes
* Code samples

Diving into these sections will give you a solid understanding of how to document REST APIs.

Later, you'll dive into different ways to publish REST API documentation, exploring tools and specifications such as API Blueprint, Swagger, RAML, readme.io, Jekyll, and more. 

You'll learn how to leverage templates, build interactive API consoles so users can try out requests and see responses, and learn different ways to host and publish your documentation.

Finally, in the third part of the course, you'll learn about native library APIs such as Java or C++ APIs, as well as how to document them. You'll generate a Javadoc, update parameters and class descriptions, and see how your tags affect what's included in the output. 

## Stay updated

If you're taking this course, you likely want to learn more about APIs. I publish regular articles that talk about APIs and strategies for documenting them. You can stay updated about these posts by subscribing to my free newsletter using the form below. 

## Learn with a real example and context

Because the purpose of the course is to help you learn, there are many activities that require hands-on coding and other exercises. Along with the learning activities, there are more conceptual deep dives, but the focus is always on *learning by doing*.

Note that this course is intended to be sequential, walking you through a series of concepts and activities that build on each other. But you can skip around as you want if you're already familiar with a concept.

## No programming skills required

As for the needed technical background for the course, you don't need any programming background or other prerequisites, but it will be helpful to know some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

If you do have some familiarity with programming concepts, you can speed through some of the sections and jump ahead to the topics you want to learn more about. This course assumes you're a beginner, though. If something is obvious, feel free to skip to where you feel you're actually learning something.

Some of the code samples in this course use JavaScript. JavaScript may or may not be a language that you actually use when you document REST APIs, but most likely there will be some programming language or platform that becomes important to know. 

JavaScript is one of the most practical and easy languages to become familiar with, so it works well in code samples for this introduction to REST API documentation.

## What you'll need

Here are a few things you'll need in this course: 

* **Text editor**. ([Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is a good option (it works on both Mac and Windows), but any text editor will do. On Windows, [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [Komodo Edit](http://komodoide.com/komodo-edit/) are also good.)
* **[Chrome browser](http://www.google.com/chrome/)**. (Other browsers are fine too, but we'll be using Chrome's Developer Console.)
* **[Postman - REST Client (Chrome app)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en)**. Postman is a Chrome app that allows you to make requests and see responses through a GUI client.
* **[cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/)**. cURL is essential for making requests to endpoints from the command line. Mac computers already have cURL installed. Windows users should follow the instructions for installing cURL [here](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203691436-Installing-and-using-cURL#install). 
* **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**. Git is a version control tool developers often use to collaborate on code. See [Set Up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) for more details. 
* **[Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)**. This is an FTP client for transferring files to a web host.
* **Network connection**. Your computer needs to be able to connect to a wifi network.
