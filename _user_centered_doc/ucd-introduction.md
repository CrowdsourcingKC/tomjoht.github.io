Recently I gave a two-hour workshop to a company on user-centered documentation. You can view the slides here:

<a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/files/user-centered-documentation-principles/"><img style="max-width: 350px" src="/images/ucdthumb2.png" />

I decided to convert the presentation into a course on my site (similar to my [API doc course](http://idratherbewriting.com/docapis_course_overview/)).

Rather than populating the course page by page, I instead pasted the content from the presentation into different pages as a skeleton outline for the course. You can navigate the pages using the sidebar on the left.

My plan is to go through the 20 or so pages in the course and fill in the details with narrative, background, examples, and other detail. I'll be working on this through 2017. For now, though, you can get an idea of the course from the skeleton content.

## Observations in Usability Labs

You can learn a lot by watching users in usability labs. At a previous company, we had a usability lab and did some testing with help docs for about 5 different users.

I gained some good insights from these usability sessions. For example, beginning users prefer video. Advanced users like the skim text.

However, these insights were drawn from only about 5 different test subjects. It could take years of observation to arrive at a core set of design principles that would be tried-and-true, tested thoroughly across many different documentation scenarios and user demographics.

Rather than try to reinvent the wheel by launching thousands of usability studies focused on documentation, I decided instead to piggyback on known design principles. There are already an abundance of known, researched, universal principles of design that have been validated time and again.

## Universal Principles of Design

To leverage existing principles of design, I draw upon a subset of design principles from [Universal Principles of Design](https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-William-Lidwell/dp/1592530079), by William Lidwell, Kritina Holden, and Jill Butler.

This book has more than 125 design principles. I read through them all and selected about 20 that are relevant to documentation scenarios.

## Applicable Design Principles

The following are the most applicable design principles to documentation. I've grouped them into two main categories.

### Creating content

* Freeze-Flight-Fight-Forfeit
* Readability
* Legibility
* Signal-to-Noise Ratio
* Picture Superiority Effect
* Performance Load
* Personas
* Normal Distribution
* Design by committee
* Depth of processing
* Iteration

### Organizing content

* Modularity
* Hierarchy
* Five Hat Racks
* Progressive Disclosure
* Entry point
* Desire line
* Wayfinding
* Immersion
* Consistency
* Forgiveness

The book covers each principles superficially in a few pages, with links to more reading. Additionally, the principles are in no particular order (they're listed alphabetically).

Also note that the authors do not explicitly tie these design principles to any particular domain (such as documentation). These universal principles of design have a sense of being cross-domain in their applicability.

When I present each principles, I try to summarize it and spin the principle as it would apply to creating documentation.
