<p>I am looking into the field of technical communication.  To give you some background, I am 30 years old, I hold a Bachelor's of Science in Psychology, and my job history has been sporadic to say the least.  What they don't tell you, or maybe I just failed to understand, in psychology is that a bachelors degree is about as useful as a high school diploma.  I cant completely blame them however because I should have found this out myself as I consider myself to be a rather intelligent person.</p>
<p>I have a strong background in computers and technology, and I love to write.  However, these have only been in my personal life, and not in any job setting.  So when I apply for positions, it seems that it doesn't matter to them how much of my free time is spent doing these things, they want specific job related experience of which I have little.  I have worked in areas such as fine art reproduction, digital imaging, customer service, and sales.  While I was getting my degree I just took whatever jobs I could get that would work around my schedule.  At the time I was too willfully ignorant of the idea of finding jobs related to what I was studying.</p>
<p>I feel like I am just rambling on without actually getting to a point.  I have been researching the technical communication field and I feel like I have finally found something that I want to make a career out of.  I am ready for a change and ready to do whatever it takes to prepare myself for and succeed in this field.  So the reason for my email is to ask, with my background in mind, what should be my next step?  I am currently looking into a second bachelors degree.  There is a program at the University of Utah in Mass Communication with an emphasis in "new media."  I was wondering if you had any thoughts on this.  I noticed that are in Utah as well (I'm currently living in Lehi), which makes me even more hopeful that you might be able to point me in the right direction as far as local resources are concerned.  I really appreciate your time, and I hope to hear back from you soon.</p>
