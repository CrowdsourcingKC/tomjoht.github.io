<p>story: organizing help, but is much more than that -- ldstech, blog. but within a help system, you have a mix of all kinds of content: cs help, videos, manuals, quick reference guides, online help, recorded webinars, who knows what else. </p>
<p>how do you find content: organize it for your audience</p>
<p>but what if you have a lot of different types of audience, even if you have a small audience, still not clear</p>
<p>topic-based organization fails when you have large numbers of topics. the organization only makes sense to you. things don't fit so neatly into different buckets.</p>
<p>holding on to the idea that it's not so much how we say it, but that people can't find it. you open up the giant help file and your eyes glaze over at the abundance of topics. you try the search, but you don't know the right terms and so the results don't find it.</p>
<p>there's a lot written for IA in general, but it mostly applies to websites. i've yet to see the information architecture of help published. would like to bridge this gap over the coming year.</p>
<p>part of this problem comes from the topic-based authoring model. you have discrete topics that are standalone, that exist without the larger context. don day's post about how this modularity falls apart under search, because you get one little topic that isn't connected to anything else.</p>
<p>not recommending abandoning topic-based hierarchy, just not using it as the only means of navigation. </p>
<p>the idea of faceted classification<br />
organizing by audience, role, department<br />
organizing by skill level<br />
organizing by format: video, quick reference, manual, online help, mobile output<br />
organizing by most popular (most emailed, most blogged, most viewed, most searched)<br />
internal organiztaion with related links or next links or cross references<br />
organizing by date (by release, by most recently added to the help)<br />
organizing by tags and categories<br />
organizing by social media? most emailed, most viewed, most tweeted<br />
browse by problem/kb article/ what's broken (twitter, e.g., ). i like this. rather than looking at functionality, you're looking at things that are wrong.<br />
organize by location (put the content in the location where it applies)<br />
organize by alphabetical order (index)<br />
organizing by story, </p>
<p>you can also add these in combination. second level facets, helps users narrow their information.</p>
<p>other aspects to findability</p>
<p>organization depends in part on the medium. print is a more linear experience.<br />
search. major problem is that user's terms aren't the official terms. help authoring tools aren't architected well for SEO, mostly due to their frames.<br />
in-application content</p>
