<p>dual monitors</p>
<p>think about the life of the video</p>
<p>single sourcing scripts from help</p>
<p>do you structure the video script as a story? everything is a problem to solve? that might work well.</p>
<p>you could have people critique a video script. yes, start with this script, read i t, and have people offer their criticism of what's wrong with it. then go through and base your whole presentation pulling out things that are wrong with it, and then fix it.</p>
<p>how to simplify your writing -- constructions that lead with long introductory phrases</p>
<p>if you simplify it too much, you remove all emotion and it becomes quite boring</p>
<p>video scripts must be short. 3 minute target.</p>
<p>100 words = 1 minute</p>
<p>purpose of the videos: mostly introductory, not advanced.</p>
<p>language must be really simple.</p>
<p>no long periods with no action. that's really tough to keep viewer's attention.</p>
<p>general template: 1-2 overview sentences.</p>
<p>end with some kind of practice.</p>
<p>how to note actions in a script.</p>
<p>how to dub over script and merge (my process).</p>
<p>contextualize in real scenario, a fictitious scenario to make it real.</p>

<p>tips for reading copy.</p>
