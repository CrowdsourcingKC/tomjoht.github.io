why use swagger
fe who immediately wanted to try it
these give visual shape to your api
some writers just deliver this and nothing more
need content in a specific format if you want systems to process it

what is the problem you're trying to solve?

should swagger be an integral part of every help system?
yes, works great as a getting started guide and a tutorial.

why aren't more swagger docs tutorial related?

can you combine the tutorial with the swagger?

why couldn't you just use postman for this? 
- doesn't contain the same doc

i think this is a great place to start with an API.

is this specification like dita?

how can i be anti-dita but pro swagger?

some APIs can't be modeled with swagger?

could you make use of it this way? https://apitransformer.com/


https://apimatic.io/ seems like an incredibly useful site

why aren't dev shops driving this?

can you champion this internally?

there are lots of things you can only do by standardization. if you start doing things your own way, don't you set yourself back decades since everyone has to operate independently.
