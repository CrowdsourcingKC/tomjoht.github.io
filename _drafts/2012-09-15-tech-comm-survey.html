<p>NOTE: The survey is focused on people who work in technical communication and training departments (workers and managers), not single consultants or contractors.

The survey contains several question types (multiple choice, short comment, etc.) and should take approximately <a href="http://emailgame.baydin.com/play#">5-</a>10 minutes to complete, depending on your answers. You cannot save the survey and return later to complete it. So, please complete this survey in one sitting.</div>
