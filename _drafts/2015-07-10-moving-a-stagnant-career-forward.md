I recently received the following question:

<blockquote>
Hi Tom,

 I'm an avid reader of your blog and I'm writing to seek your advise on improving my stagnant career.

I'm a Technical Writer working in London, UK for a financial services consulting firm. I'm a computer science graduate and I chose technical writing as I loved writing more than programming.

In my short career spanning a little less than 5 years, I've documented many web-based and windows-based software applications and learnt quite a few authoring tools like Adobe Framemaker,  Adobe Robohelp, etc. I've also developed e-learning modules using Adobe Captivate.

Of late I feel I'm doing monotonous work and that I'm not learning anything new. Also my salary isn't good enough for a person with 5 years experience. In an expensive city like London my salary is just enough to get by (thankfully my husband is a Java developer and gets good salary). 

I'm stuck in this low-paying job and I don't know how I can improve my career path. In my current job I get to use Microsoft Sharepoint through which I've learned HTML/CSS, Javascript up to beginner level, but this is just out of interest and I know that's not going to help me as a technical writer. I feel that career prospects for a technical writer isn't great as user interfaces are becoming more and more intuitive, what do you say?

I constantly update myself about the new tools and trends in the field of technical writing reading your blog. I really admire you for you have grown so much as a technical writer and I look up to you as my role model.

I don't know if you've got time to answer questions from your readers but I'd be very grateful if you could suggest some ways to build my stagnant career.

I've got these questions for you:

* Are there any technical writing certifications that I can do?

* What technical writing tools can I learn on my own in my spare time?

* How can I learn API documentation?

* What programming languages should I learn in order to become a successful, high-earning technical writer?

Your help and advice would be much appreciated. Looking forward to your reply. Hope you won't disappoint me.

Moving forward out of stagnancy is not difficult. Fortunately, there's an easy answer to this question: get into API documentation. When you enter this realm,
