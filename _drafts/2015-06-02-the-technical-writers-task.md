## Facing complex information

The other day I was asked to update documentation for the latest release. The team pointed me to some wiki pages that described the new features. As I looked through the pages, they were full of engineering speak as thick as it gets, with java methods, acronyms, almost no explanation of the context or "why" behind the feature, and other technical blah blah blah.

After 5 minutes, I browsed to another tab and looked for something else to do. I didn't want to deal with figuring all of that out right then. Soon I came back to the page, and this time read it more slowly. This time I started to take notes, pulling out the essential information. 

It still looked like gobbley gook. When engineers take notes, they seem to revel in making things as cryptic as possible, so only they can understand what they've written.

## The technical writer's task

The technical writer's task, more or less, is to decode complexity. We take something incredibly dense and difficult to figure out, and little by little we unravel it. We decode the tech speak into natural, understandable, readable language.

## Approaches for tackling complexity

Given that we bang our heads against complexity all day, do we have methods for figuring things out? As much as I hear about how the technical writer's task is to "simplify complexity," there is the initial task of understanding the complexity enough to convey the concepts and tasks in simple speak. 

## Step one: Break it into small pieces

To decode the indecipherable engineering speak, I decided to break it into small pieces. This is the first step to unraveling complexity. As a whole, it is immense and impenetrable. So you take a little piece of it and own that piece. Define the acronyms, understand the concepts, figure out the code. 

Then you take another piece, and another piece, and so on. 

## Step two: Be an investigative reporter

Much of the information on the page had a surrounding context where engineers discussed things in meetings -- meetings I hadn't been in (and frankly, which I really didn't want to attend). Spring planning, special issues, backend coding decisions, and such. 

I set about asking engineers around me for information. Every time I talk to an engineer, I get a firehose of information that illuminates so much before me. 

## Step three: Draw a picture
