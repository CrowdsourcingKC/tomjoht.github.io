<p>When applications near release, the project manager usually sits down with someone from support to discuss a strategy for supporting the application after release. I was sitting in one such meeting today, and the PM commenced to complete a form detailing the scope and size of the upcoming support. </p>
<p>The support manager asked for some basic facts, such as the number of users, the estimated number of calls per day, the length of the rollout, and ongoing needs for support. It turns out to cost about two dollars for every call made to the call center. When you multiply this number by the calls per month with the time frame, costs start to add up in a scary way. With some of our estimations, we were suddenly looking at a half million dollars to support the product after rollout. </p>
<p>The project manager raised his eyebrows. It suddenly became very clear that if we could, through excellent help material, reduce the number of calls, we could dramatically reduce this number. I never felt a greater sense of justification and need for the tech writer role. I've always heard things like "we're a cost center," and "the impact of help is hard to quantify," but looking at half a million dollar estimated support cost on the screen, I knew that the content I produced would have far-reaching influence.</p>
