context for tech comm audience

what was the problem for which jekyll was the solution?
introducing jekyll
 - open source, ruby-based, build from the command line
 - developed by tom warner at Github
 - the origin of the hacker phase
 - supported by Github, integrates with Github Pages
 - there are lots of static site gens, but Jekyll is most popular, has Github's backing

the whole philosophy of static site generators
 - no database
 - build the site prior to serving it
 - 100% secure
 - lightweight
 - HTML, CSS, JS-based
 - you do whatever you want
lots of other static site gens staticgen.com
jekyll not necessarily designed for tech docs, but works extremely well for this

context for developer audience

- wanted to use jekyll as a flexible, lightweight platform for producing documentation in a modern web format
- in tech comm circles, the common tools are help authoring tools or structured authoring tools. e.g., flare, robohelp, dita, framemaker.
- the problem is that HATs typically produce antiquated-looking websites in a box, which are hard to modify and look like they belong in 1995.
- tech writers have certain needs and constraints, and it can be a challenge to try to meet those needs with jekyll. usually when tech writers select a tool, they draw up a list of their requirements, round up some candidate tools, and then see which best fits the criteria.
- problem is that you can't really understand how a tool would work until you actually use it, beyond a simple pilot.
- this talk shares my journey of how i tried to overcome classic tech writer needs using jekyll.
- this will be useful for any developer-oriented person who is providing the tooling foundation for their tech writing team.

challenge #1: Conditional filtering
- main challenge is that markdown is too simple to handle complex tech comm scenarios
- tech writers deliver multiple outputs to different audiences, versions, and roles
- most web designers have one main site, but tech writers often produce lots of discrete sites
- show people liquid and it opens up a lot of possibilities and understanding
- you can do more with liquid than you can with DITA


challenge #2: Multiple outputs
- different config files for different outputs


challenge #3: Multi-level navigation menu


challenge #4: Notes, tips, alerts

challenge #5: No broken links

challenge #6: PDF


challenge #7: Content re-use


challenge #8: Push doc to various environments


challenge #9: Collaboration
- use Git, Mercurial
- plug into engineering tooling, workflow
- merge conflicts


challenge #10: Simplicity
- team members who drag their feet
- what happens when you leave
- a non-standard solution


---

Larger challenges to solve:

challenge #1: Search

challenge #2: Translation

challenge #3: Authentication

challenge #4: Content re-use across projects

challenge #5: Standardization -- when you leave, you don't want all the knowledge trapped with one person
