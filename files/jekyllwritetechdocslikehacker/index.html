context for tech comm audience

what was the problem for which jekyll was the solution?
introducing jekyll
 - open source, ruby-based, build from the command line
 - developed by tom warner at Github
 - the origin of the hacker phase
 - supported by Github, integrates with Github Pages
 - there are lots of static site gens, but Jekyll is most popular, has Github's backing

the whole philosophy of static site generators
 - no database
 - build the site prior to serving it
 - 100% secure
 - lightweight
 - HTML, CSS, JS-based
 - you do whatever you want
lots of other static site gens staticgen.com
jekyll not necessarily designed for tech docs, but works extremely well for this

context for developer audience

- wanted to use jekyll as a flexible, lightweight platform for producing documentation in a modern web format
- in tech comm circles, the common tools are help authoring tools or structured authroing tools. e.g., flare, robohelp, dita, framemaker.
- tech writers have certain needs and constraints, and it can be a challenge to try to meet those needs with jekyll.
- this talk shares my journey of how i tried to overcome classic tech writer needs using jekyll.
- this will be useful for any developer-oriented person who is providing the tooling foundation for their tech writing team.

challenge #1: Conditional filtering
- main challenge is that markdown is too simple to handle complex tech comm scenarios
- tech writers deliver multiple outputs to different audiences, versions, and roles
- most web designers have one main site, but tech writers often produce lots of discrete sites
- show people liquid and it opens up a lot of possibilities and understanding
- you can do more with liquid than you can with DITA

challenge #2: Multiple outputs
- different config files for different outputs


challenge #3: Multi-level navigation menu


challenge #3: Content re-use


challenge #4: PDF


challenge #5: Notes, tips, alerts




challenge #7: No broken links


challenge #8: Push doc to various environments


challenge #9: Collaboration
- use Git, Mercurial
- plug into engineering tooling, workflow
- merge conflicts


challenge #10: Simplicity
- team members who drag their feet
- what happens when you leave
- a non-standard solution


---

Larger challenges to solve:

challenge #1: Search

challenge #2: Translation

challenge #3: Authentication

challenge #4: Content re-use across projects



----

Overall

Most likely no problem you can't solve with some creativity.
Challenge is to make it all push-button simple. Avoid escalating complexity.
I love flexibility. You can make Jekyll do nearly anything you want.


my use of jekyll
 - used it on tech doc projects over the past 1.5 yrs
 - had to overcome all the major challenges that tech writers face
 - had to be creative in way approach, since it's not always clearly defined

plan: look at the top 10 challenges with doc, and find out how to solve them using jekyll

Conditional filtering


Content re-use


PDF


Collaboration with other writers


Notes, tips, alerts


Multi-level table of contents
 - sidebar navigation
 -

Managed links

Variables

Versioning

Translation

Notification of broken stuff

Easily push into different environments


Multiple outputs


Challenges

- Merge conflicts
- Getting Jekyll installed
- Keeping things simple
- Converting content into Markdown
- Setting up the PDF generation process
- Doc reviews
- Users on Windows
- Multiple outputs
- Search
- Authentication
- pushing jekyll from one environment to another -- baseurls and urls change. you don't want to have multiple outputs. just one output that you transfer from one environment to another. way to accomplish this is via relative urls, and no permalinks. then it means everything is in root.
- scenario of pulling content into a larger site. then everyone authors in their own theme. how do you update the theme while keeping the content fluid? well, it's kind of a challenge.
- not breaking links. talk about your managed link stuff
- toc with so many conditional statements.
- pdf and that mountain. it's interesting how you overcame all of these issues one by one.
- sharing content across projects. overcame by having everyone use same project!
- formatting errors in jekyll. use includes.
