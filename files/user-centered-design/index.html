                    <h2>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h2>
                    <p>Focus the users' attention on what matters by reducing extraneous information. Eliminate content that is merely "noise" as opposed to meaningful information.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        <p><a href="https://learn.mdsol.com/gm/contracting/creating-master-budgets-in-grants-manager-contracting-53357038.html">Sample</a> "More about negotiating benefits" seems redundant with navigation on left. Seems like this is EPPO's attempt at creating cross-links, but it comes across as noise to me. It's redundant with the nav on the left. It should only contain links to content outside of this space, and then it should probably appear at the end.</p>
                    </aside>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Normal Distribution</h2>
                    <p>Document what most users need to know, and omit info that applies to only a small percentage of users (edge cases or obvious information). Adding it into the main doc dilutes the information for the majority.</p>

                    <aside class="notes"><a href="https://learn.mdsol.com/csa/en/csa-about-handling-incorrect-dates-65025158.html">Sample</a>. Seems like this is an edge case that might be better suited to a KB article. It's hard for me to discern what might be a fringe case because I'm not familiar with the content. </aside>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Personas</h2>
                    <p>Create fictitious descriptions of users based on real research to guide decision-making about design. These personas help you remember that you're not the user. Three primary personas and four secondary personas are sufficient.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
Who is medidata (or iMedidata) for? If there are clearly defined personas, perhaps it should be more apparent who the various roles the doc is targeting. Here's the <a href="https://learn.mdsol.com/imedidata/en/about-imedidata-55479806.html">About page</a>. It says "Whether you are a study builder, clinical research coordinator (CRC), investigator, study administrator, clinical data manager (CDM), or site monitor, you can use iMedidata to access all your studies." There's also a developer role. But the doc is all lumped together into one site with multiple spaces, but it's hard to know which space corresponds to which role. Maybe some more high level entry point info around which spaces are designed for which roles.

                        <h2>Five Hat Racks</h2>
                    <p>You can organize content in 5 ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Alphabet</li>
                        <li>Time</li>
                        <li>Location</li>
                        <li>Continuum (degree)</li>
                        <li>Category (likeness)</li>
                    </ul>
                        <p>Generally, doc is grouped by category more than location (except with context-sensitive help). Tags can facilitate multiple organization schemes.</p>

Organize around category instead of location except for context-sensitive help that might appear for that tab. some content resists organization by category, but it's the default. one strategy might be to implement tags that provide alternative organization schemes.

                        <p>One proposed solution to the problem of organization is faceted classification.

                    <h2>Hierarchy</h2>
                    <p>A hierarchical outline of the content (with parent and child items organized in trees) helps users both understand and visualize complex information. </p>
                    <p>Hierarchies that are too complex, or which hide parent-child displays, fail to communicate. Find a balance that allows users to take in the hierarchy at a glance in a meaningful way.</p>

                        <h3>Hierarchy best practices</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Limit navigation (hierarchy) to 3 levels, placed on left</li>
                            <li>Allow users to see the full navigation menu at a glance</li>
                            <li>Break up massive navigation into multiple  menus</li>
                            <li>Provide a way to navigate from one nav menu to another</li>
                            <li>Put page-level navigation on the page, preferably on right</li>
                        </ul>

                        <aside class="notes">
<a href="https://learn.mdsol.com/imedidata/en/about-imedidata-user-loader-55479820.html">Example</a>. It's hard to take in the sidebar at a glance. The titles are clipped (maybe just remove "in Medidata"). The third-level expands only when you expand the second level. There's a sense that the information hierarchy could be much more complex than you would know. Also, the navigation is made more complex by all the links on the right. Those links on the right seem superflous and unnecessary. The Spaces link at the top is good in that it allows you to navigate from one space to another.

                    <h2>Cost-Benefit | Performance Load </h2>
                        <p><b>Cost-benefit</b>: Users apply a cost-benefit analysis to reading documentation. Is it worth spending hours in the documentation for the benefit? </p>
                    <p><b>Performance load</b>: The larger the documentation, the greater the performance load will be on the user. With greater performance load, the user's chance of success decreases.</p>

                    <p>Instead of eliminating potentially useful info, provide quick reference guides that help users get oriented quickly with minimal cognitive load and low cost.</p>
