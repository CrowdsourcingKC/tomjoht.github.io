In this series on visual communication, I'm going to explore in depth a variety of topics in visual communication, such as:

* screenshots
* diagrams
* concept illustrations
* SVG graphics
* translation
* image file management
* graphics programs
* professional-looking images
* design principles, and more

For a little background about why I started this course, see [Starting a new series on visual communication](http://idratherbewriting.com/2016/03/12/new-series-on-visual-communication/). 

The content here is a draft in progress. I will be publishing about two new sections a week here for the next year.
