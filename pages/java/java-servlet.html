<p>A servlet is a Java class that serves up HTML to a browser.</p>
<p>When a user goes to a URL containing the servlet, the <code>doGet</code> method will get the logic ...</p>
<p>The request is what the browser sends to the servlet. The response is what the servlet sends back to the browser.</p>
<p>The servlet has a URL that corresponds to it.</p>
<p>You normally don't write HTML to the servlet. You put your HTML into a java servlet page (jsp).</p>
<p>You put your web content inside the Web Content directory.</p>
<p>The JSP page is actually compiled into a servlet before the server runs it.</p>
