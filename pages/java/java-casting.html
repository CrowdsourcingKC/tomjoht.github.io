<h2>Quick summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>A way of converting one value type to another</li>
</ul>
<p>Eclipse example: casting</p>
<h2>Detailed description</h2>
<p>Casting is a way of converting one value type to another. In Java, values have value types allotted for them. You don't just create a variable and set it to any number, because the system has to reserve space for that value. Larger values need larger amounts of space reserved.</p>
<pre><code>byte 2;
int 600;
</code></pre>
<p>It would be inefficient to allot all values the same space in your system. You can change the value types from one to another. This is called casting.</p>
<p>Suppose you have this:</p>
<pre><code>byte myByte = 20; // max is 27
short myShort = 67;
int myInt = 899;
long myLong = 88;
float myFloat = 235.5f;
double myDouble = 8000.7;
</code></pre>
<p>Now you want to convert your long to a double. You can't do it because the double doesn't fit into the long.</p>
<pre><code>myLong = myDouble;
System.out.println(myLong);
</code></pre>
<p>However, the reverse would work:</p>
<pre><code>myDouble = myLong;
System.out.println(myDouble);
</code></pre>
<p>But now you have the problem that you're using more memory than needed to accommodate the myDouble. It only needs to hold a long value. So you cast it like this:</p>
<pre><code>myDouble = (double)myLong;
System.out.println(myDouble);
</code></pre>
<p>This changes the value type to double.</p>
