<p>This section contains my notes on Java. It's a constantly evolving section, and I put the notes here mainly to provide quick access for me to review and update my knowledge about various Java topics.</p>
<p>In some topics, there is mention of an Eclipse Example. I'll be putting up a bunch of sample code for Eclipse soon.</p>
