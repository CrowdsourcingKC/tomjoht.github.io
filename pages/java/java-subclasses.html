<h2>Quick summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>use <code>extends</code> keyword</li>
<li>subclasses inherits members of superclass</li>
<li>unlike with interfaces, you're not required to use all the fields and methods of the superclass</li>
</ul>
<p>Eclipse example: subclasses</p>
<h2>Detailed description</h2>
<p>You can extend a class. When you do this, you basically create a subclass that inherits the parent classes' members.</p>
<pre><code>public class Apple extends Fruit
</code></pre>
<p>Now Apple can use all of Fruit's members (fields and methods). However, unlike interfaces, when you extend a class, you are not required to use all of the fields and methods of the parent class.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  ... extends, lets us know the class's parent class. A class's parent (more properly, a super) class is the class from which the current class gets the bases of its definition. In particular, a class can use all public and protected methods in its parent class just as though they had been defined in the class at hand.</p>
<p>  -- Java 7 for Absolute Beginners</p>
<p>  Inheritance defines relationships between the classes (and so between the objects) within an object-oriented system. All classes in Java have some other object as a parent. Java developers say that one object extends another. If you think about it for a minute, you shortly realize that there must be some object that starts it all. That special object (the only one that has no parent) is a class called Object. All other Java objects are descendants (sometimes through many levels) of Object.</p>

<p>Java can only inherit from one parent class. You cannot have multiple parents. However, you can have a class extend multiple interfaces.</p>
