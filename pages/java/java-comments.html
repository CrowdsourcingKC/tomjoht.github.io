<p>End of line comments:</p>
<pre><code>// comment
</code></pre>
<p>Convenient but if you write code after the //, it all gets grayed out.</p>
<p>Block comments:</p>
<pre><code>/* comment */
</code></pre>
<p>Advantage is that they can appear anywhere, span multiple lines, etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  And here's a line of code with a comment in the middle of it:</p>
<p>  int counter /* comment */ = 0;<br />
  Please don't do that. It's legal, but it's poor coding practice, because it makes the code harder to read.<br />

</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that Javadoc comments are similar to block comments but with an extra asterisk at the beginning:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code> /**
   * This method makes a Cat object chase the given Mouse object.
   * @param mouse an instance of the Mouse class for our cat to chase
   */'
   -- Java 7 for Absolute Beginners
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Really important tip: Don't worry about line breaks when you're writing comments. Press Command + Shift + F and it formats everything. You want to keep comments to about 80px. Get into the issue of line breaks with code. Sometimes line breaks with commands can be problematic -- such as wrapping comment code.</p>
