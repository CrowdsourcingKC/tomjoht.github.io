<p>Tomcat is a web server that allows you to run Java in JSP pages.</p>
<h1>Install Tomcat</h1>
<ul>
<li>Download JDK (Java Development Kit) and JRE (Java RunTime Environment).</li>
<li>Download Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers Eclipse. If you have the regular Java version of Eclipse already installed, you need to add the Java EE perspective. </li>
<li>Install Tomcat (a web server). Binary distributions, under Core, choose targ.gz or if Windows, 32-bit/64. </li>
</ul>
<p>Industrial strength installations use Apache that redirects to Tomcat to redirect to Java Servlets.</p>
<h2>Installing Tomcat</h2>
<p>There's a version of Tomcat installed with Eclipse that will create conflicts. Change some of the ports for the Tomcat installation that exists outside of your version of Eclipse.</p>
<h2>Configuring Tomcat within Eclipse</h2>
<p>Click Workbench, then click Add New Server. Browse to your Tomcat installation directory.</p>
<p>Once configured, you should be able to start and stop servers in the Servers tab.</p>
<p>'Ports used by tomcat are already in use.' Go to your tomcat installation, stop it.</p>
<p>It's odd because it's like Eclipse launches its own thread with Tomcat even though it's using the same Tomcat installation.</p>
