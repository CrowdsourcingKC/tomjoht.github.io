<h1 class="title topictitle1">DITA Quick reference guide introduction</h1>
<div class="body conbody">
<p class="shortdesc">This DITA Quick Reference Guide (DITA QRG) provides quick notes for using DITA,<br />
  particularly with OxygenXML. </p>
<p class="p">The emphasis here is on quick explanations showing code samples, as well as tips and<br />
   recommendations for working with various elements. </p>
<p class="p">Although they started out as personal notes, I'm making these notes public and enabling comment<br />
   controls because I hope to benefit from the expertise and insights of others. I plan to continue<br />
   adding to these notes regularly, growing my understanding and helping others understand DITA in a<br />
   quick and easy way too.</p>
<p class="p">If you have feedback on any topics, please add a comment on the topic to share your thoughts.<br />
   If you don't see a topic mentioned, <a class="xref external" href="http://idratherbewriting.com/contact" target="_blank">contact me</a> and I'll add it.</p>
<p class="p">Note that the full reference for DITA is available at the <a class="xref external" href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/DITA1.2-spec.html" target="_blank">1.2 specification</a>. Additionally, the help for OxygenXML is available on their <a class="xref external" href="http://oxygenxml.com/documentation.html" target="_blank">documentation page</a>.</p>
