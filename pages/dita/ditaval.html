<h1 class="title topictitle1">DITA: Ditaval files (filtering attributes from your transforms)</h1>
<div class="body conbody">
<p class="shortdesc">Ditaval files define conditional processing rules for your transforms. </p>
<p class="p">When you want to apply conditional processing in your output, you can put these rules into a
   ditaval file. </p>
<p class="p">Oxygen has the same ditaval functionality built into its interface, so you don't need to create
   a custom ditaval file in order to have the rules reflected in your output. You may be pushing
   your content out to another system, however (such as Fluid Topics or Suiteshare), and in that
   case, you'll need to create ditaval files. Having the ditaval files available in your dita files
   will instruct the system on how to publish your content.</p>
<div class="p">The ditaval file consists of the
   following:
<pre class="pre codeblock"><val>
    <prop action="exclude" att="platform" val="mac" />
    <prop action="exclude" att="platform" val="linux" />
    <prop action="exclude" att="product" val="acme"/>
</val></pre>
</div>
<p class="p">You specify the action (almost always exclude), the attribute (<code>att</code>), and the
   value (<code>val</code>). In this ditaval file, any properties that have
    <code>platform="mac"</code> or <code>platform="linux"</code> or
    <code>product="acme"</code> will be excluded from the output. Any elements with those
   attribute values will be excluded.</p>
<p class="p">(You can change the default action to include and run more sophisticated logic in your ditaval
   file if you so choose. But by default everything is included. The basic idea is to specify what
   you want excluded.)</p>
