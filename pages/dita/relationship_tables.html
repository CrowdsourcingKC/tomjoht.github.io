<h1 class="title topictitle1">DITA: Relationship tables</h1>
<div class="body conbody">
<p class="shortdesc">You can manage links to each topic through a "relationship table." Based on the way you<br />
    arrange topics in a relationship table, you end up with a list of related links at the end of<br />
    each topic. </p>
<p class="p">A relationship table is an actual table grid that defines the way topics link to each other.<br />
      You add links to topics in the table's rows and columns. Topics in the same row link to each<br />
      other. When you output your help, if some of the topics aren't included in the output, they<br />
      are intelligently not included in the relationship table, so your links don't break.</p>
<p class="p">There are quite a few options for how you can define the linking relationships, but here's<br />
      the easiest way to implement relationship tables. </p>
<p class="p toc">
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Wait until the end to create the links</h2>
<p class="p">First, wait until you're mostly done with your help content before you start creating link<br />
        relationships. You may be changing link names as you write and organize files, and it<br />
        doesn't make sense to try to establish linking relationships to content that is still in<br />
        constant flux.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Link related topics through your topicheads directly</h2>
<div class="p">In your map file, for each <samp class="ph codeph">topichead</samp> area (which groups topics together),<br />
      add the<samp class="ph codeph"> collection-type</samp> attribute with a value of <samp class="ph codeph">family</samp>,<br />
      like<br />
      this:
<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;topichead navtitle="Links" collection-type="family"&gt;
 &lt;topicref href="keyref_links.dita"/&gt;
 &lt;topicref href="inline_links.dita"/&gt;
 &lt;topicref href="related_links.dita"/&gt;
 &lt;topicref href="relationship_tables.dita"/&gt;
 &lt;/topichead&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="p">All of the topics in this group will link to each other via related links at the bottom (just<br />
        like with relationship tables). You don't have to actually create a relationship table at<br />
        all with this method. In almost all cases, you want to link these groups of files to each<br />
        other. </p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Linking topics that appear in different groups</h2>
<div class="p">For topics that should link across groups, you need to create a relationship table grid in<br />
        your map file and establish which topics you want linked to each other. Here's the key thing<br />
        to remember with relationship tables:
<ul class="ul" id="concept_wl4_ssl_q4__ul_sbs_zj5_q4">
<li class="li">Topics in the same row link to each other. </li>
<li class="li">Topics in the same cell do not link to each other.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">Here's an example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">    
      &lt;reltable&gt;
      &lt;relheader&gt;   
   &lt;relcolspec type="concept"&gt;
   &lt;relcolspec type="task"&gt;
   &lt;relcolspec type="reference"&gt;
      &lt;/relheader&gt;
     
      &lt;relrow&gt;
        &lt;relcell&gt;
          &lt;topicref href="sample_concept.dita"/&gt;
        &lt;/relcell&gt;
      
        &lt;relcell&gt;
          &lt;topicref href="task_example1.dita"/&gt;
          &lt;topicref href="task_example2.dita"/&gt;
        &lt;/relcell&gt;

        &lt;relcell&gt;
          &lt;topicref href="referencefile.dita"/&gt;
         &lt;/relcell&gt;
      &lt;/relrow&gt;
    &lt;/reltable&gt;
   </pre>
<p class="p">It may make more sense to actually show the table in its display form: </p>
<div class="tablenoborder">
<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" id="table_ryr_xwv_x4" class="table" frame="border" border="1" rules="all">
<thead class="thead" align="left">
<tr class="row">
<th class="entry" valign="top" id="d9296e100">Concept</th>
<th class="entry" valign="top" id="d9296e103">Task</th>
<th class="entry" valign="top" id="d9296e106">Reference</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody class="tbody">
<tr class="row">
<td class="entry" valign="top" headers="d9296e100 ">sample_concept.dita</td>
<td class="entry" valign="top" headers="d9296e103 ">
<p class="p">task_example1.dita </p>
<p class="p">task_example2.dita</p>
</td>
<td class="entry" valign="top" headers="d9296e106 ">referencefile.dita</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p class="p">In this relationship table, sample_concept.dita will have links to task_example1.dita,<br />
        task_example2.dita, and referencefile.dita because they're in the same row. </p>
<p class="p">However, task_example1.dita and task_example2.dita will not have links to each other<br />
        because they're in the same cell.</p>
<p class="p">If you want topics in the same cell to link to each other, add the attribute<br />
          <samp class="ph codeph">collection-type="family"</samp> to the <samp class="ph codeph">relcell</samp> element that<br />
        contains the topics you want to link to each other.</p>
<p class="p">Note: It's a lot easier to see the rows and cells when you're in the Author view.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Linking to external resources</h2>
<p class="p">Now let's say some topics link to some external files on the web. For example, suppose you<br />
        want the inline_links.dita topic to link to a topic called http://example.org. You could<br />
        manage these external resource links in the relationship table, but it's easier to manage<br />
        them in a <samp class="ph codeph">related links</samp> section of the topic itself. The related links will<br />
        be combined with the relationship table links at runtime.</p>
<div class="p">To add the <samp class="ph codeph">related-links</samp> element in a topic, add it after the<br />
          <samp class="ph codeph">conbody</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">taskbody</samp>, or <samp class="ph codeph">refbody</samp><br />
        element:
<pre class="pre codeblock"> &lt;related-links&gt;
  &lt;link href="http://example.org"&gt;Example.org&lt;/link&gt;
 &lt;/related-links&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="p">This kind of link is useful as a list of relevant resources about the topic. You don't need<br />
        to manage these links in the relationship table because, as a web resource, you don't need<br />
        to worry about the topic not being available in the output.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Column headers</h2>
<div class="p">If you want the links to be grouped into different related link sections, such as "Related<br />
        concepts," "Related tasks," and "Related information," add a <samp class="ph codeph">type</samp> attribute<br />
        to the <samp class="ph codeph">relcolspec</samp> element, like this:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;relcolspec type="concept"/&gt;
&lt;relcolspec type="task"/&gt;
&lt;relcolspec type="reference"/&gt; </pre>
</div>
<p class="p">However, I don't think it's wise to separate related links into these different topic<br />
        types, since many times readers don't clearly distinguish topic types frome ach other, and<br />
        sometimes concepts are somewhat task-like anyway. If your concepts have lite list formatting<br />
        in them (using the ol element), the distinction between tasks and concepts may be more<br />
        fuzzy.</p>
<p class="p">In fact, if you remove the column names, there isn't much reason to separate out the topics<br />
        into separate columns. You could instead just group all the topics you want to relate to<br />
        each other in the same cell and add <samp class="ph codeph">collection-type="family"</samp> for that<br />
        cell.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Working with relationship tables</h2>
<p class="p">Probably the easiest way to work with relationship tables in Oxygen is to insert the<br />
        relationship table code into the bottom of your map file in the Text view (or make sure your<br />
        cursor is in a valid place in the map file and click the Insert Relationship Table button in<br />
        the Author view). Then switch to the Author view. </p>
<p class="p">Right-click the map file header tab and select Open in DITA Maps Manager View. Drag the<br />
        topics from the maps manager view into the cells you want. Remember, if you've already added<br />
          <samp class="ph codeph">collection-type="family"</samp> to the groups in your map, then you only need to<br />
        relate those topics that fall outside of the existing groups. </p>
