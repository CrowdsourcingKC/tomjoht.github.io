<h1 class="title topictitle1">DITA: Webhelp with Feedback</h1>
<div class="body conbody">
<p class="shortdesc">You can enable commenting below your webhelp topics by selecting the Webhelp with<br />
  Feedback skin.</p>
<p class="p">Because documentation on this feature is so scant in Oxygen, I'm elaborating with a bit of<br />
      detail here.</p>
<p class="p toc">
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Setting Up the Feedback System</h2>
<p class="p">To set up this commenting system, first create a mysql database and add a user to the database<br />
        with all privileges. This process is similar for a lot of different sites (e.g., WordPress,<br />
        Drupal, Joomla), so don't assume this is anything special or difficult. Exactly how you<br />
        create a mysql database and user depends a bit on your web host. </p>
<p class="p">The instructions in Oxygen focus on using Xampp to set up this database, and they include a<br />
        specific mysql statement (<samp class="ph codeph">INSERT INTO `mysql`.`user` ...</samp>) to pass in<br />
        phpmyadmin. You can ignore Oxygen's instructions, as they're poorly written and somewhat<br />
        misleading. Xampp is for local environments (i.e., a web server emulated on your local<br />
        computer, not on an actual server on the web). You would only use Xampp for testing<br />
        purposes, not for actual deployment. The long mysql statement in Oxygen's help is<br />
        unnecessary if you simply grant the user all privileges to the database (a common<br />
        configuration). </p>
<div class="p">If you're like most tech writers, you don't have direct access to the servers where you<br />
        deploy your help content. (That's actually good, because then you don't have to maintain<br />
        them.) Request from your server admin the following:
<ul class="ul" id="concept_ssh_15r_x4__ul_elr_gz1_y4">
<li class="li">A server with Apache, MySQL, PHP &gt;=5.16, and PHP MySQL Support. (This is a standard<br />
            server deployment referred to as a LAMP stack, for linux, apache, mysql, and php.)</li>
<li class="li">Create a new MySQL database and add a user to it with all privileges. Ask for the<br />
            database name, username, and password.</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Selecting an identifier</h2>
<p class="p">When you transform the webhelp with feedback, you're prompted to use a documentation<br />
        product ID. Think of your webhelp output as a "product." If you have 3 different webhelp<br />
        outputs, you have 3 different products, each with their own unique product ID that you<br />
        specify. Always the same product ID for the same output. This identifier is included in a<br />
        configuration file so that comments are tied to a particular output. If you're publishing<br />
        the webhelp files into different directories, consider using the directory name as the<br />
        product ID.</p>
<p class="p">When you run the configuration to install webhelp with feedback, there's one option that's<br />
        a bit confusing: ""Display comments from other products. If checked, on this product pages<br />
        will be visible also comments from other specified products!"</p>
<p class="p">Understanding your webhelp outputs as "products" helps clarify this option. This means if<br />
        you have two different products, and both have a file name and path such as<br />
        topics/widgets.dita, then comments made on one instance of topics/widgets.dita will appear<br />
        on other instances of the the file topics/widgets.dita in other products. </p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Installing it the first time</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<p class="p">The first time you deploy webhelp with feedback, after you FTP the content to your server,<br />
        go to the /install directory and walk through the installation. You'll be prompted for the<br />
        database name, database username, password, as well as other configuration options. You can<br />
        change some of the options later. The installation creates a config.php file in<br />
          <span class="ph filepath">oxygen-webhelp/resources/php/config/config.php </span>where all your<br />
        configuration options are stored.</p>
<p class="p">The first time you install Webhelp with Feedback, select the check box to create a new<br />
        database structure. However, on subsequent deployments of other help files, do not select<br />
        the database structure check box. If you do, your previous database tables will be<br />
        erased/dropped and your comments removed.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Publishing subsequent revisions</h2>
<p class="p">When you publish subsequent iterations of your webhelp, don't upload the /install folder in<br />
    the output. You only need to upload the install folder first time when you create the<br />
    installation. On subsequent uploads, just upload the other output files. </p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Logging in as administrator</h2>
<p class="p">When you install Webhelp with Feedback the first time, you're prompted to create an<br />
        administrator. For subsequent product deployments, you're not prompted to create an<br />
        administrator account.</p>
<p class="p">Regardless, by default there's a user created named "administrator" that uses the<br />
        administrator's email address you set up in the configuration. If you forget the admin<br />
        account, to retrieve the password for the administrator, try logging in to the Admin panel<br />
        (in the comments area) and choose to reset your password. Once you reset the password and<br />
        can log in successfully, you can update the password.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Managing comments</h2>
<p class="p">Go to a topic in your help, log in as an administrator, and you'll see an Admin button. This<br />
        takes you to the Admin interface, which is actually shown inside a topic rather than as a<br />
        separate interface apart from the help system. There you can manage comments and control<br />
        user roles.</p>
<p class="p">There are three types of notification options: reply notification, page notification, and<br />
    webhelp notification. The reply notification sends a notification when someone makes a reply to<br />
    your comment. The page notification sends a notification if someone else adds a comment on the<br />
    same page. The webhelp notification sends a notification if anyone makes a comment on any page<br />
    in the webhelp.</p>
<p class="p">There isn't a way to surface an RSS feed or show the latest comments.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Adding Administrators</h2>
<p class="p">To enable more administrators, ask a person to create an account. The user will appear in the<br />
        Admin interface (which you access by clicking the Admin button in the comments area). You<br />
        can click the user's name and change his or her role and notification options.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Modifying file names versus topic IDs</h2>
<p class="p">You can change topic IDs without losing comment history, but you can't change the file<br />
        names and paths. The file name and path is what connects a topic with the comments<br />
        associated with it. You can continue to publish updates to the help. If the new topics have<br />
        the same file name the previous comments remain associated with the new topic. But if you<br />
        change the file name or path, the comment history for the topic is lost.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Versions</h2>
<p class="p">Each time you transform your output, you're prompted to select a version. In the Admin view<br />
        of the output, you can specify a point in time for comments to appear. For example, you can<br />
        specify that only comments after version 2.0 can appear. You do this by clicking the<br />
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Set Version</span> button. Then select the starting version from which<br />
        comments are visible (meaning visible from that version forward).</p>
