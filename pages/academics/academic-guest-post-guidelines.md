As part of my [Academic/Practitioner Conversations project](/academic-practitioner-project/), I'm highlighting research published by academics and blending spaces where practitioners and academics interact. I'm doing this by inviting academics to engage in conversation posts, guest posts, and podcasts. My hope is that through this content effort, the two groups will be drawn closer together and more effective.

## Conversation posts

This is my favorite type of post because, more than anything else, it facilitates a deep conversation. For a conversation post, I usually read one of your articles and ask a series of questions. I'll usually excerpt a passage and then ask you to explain the approach or position in light of this or that concern.

I share these passages with you in a Google doc, and then you can respond at the timeline you set. When you're finished, I publish the conversation.

I don't have any current examples of conversation posts yet, but they're coming soon.

## Guest posts

Guest posts are basically posts that you author from start to finish. You might start with an existing article you've written and create a practitioner-friendly version of the same content. Or you might explain some current research you're undertaking, or even research you're considering.

If you've grown tired of the academic discourse that you've been writing in, the guest post gives you an opportunity to write in a more creative style. You can tell a story, explain how a research topic first became relevant to you, be personal or transparent in dangerous ways. Remember, it's a blog, so there are no rules except to be interesting.

As with the conversation post, write your guest post in Google docs and share it with me. This makes it easy to convert it to Markdown.

Here's an example guest post from Emily January Peterson on [stereotypes](/2018/07/18/stereotypes-about-tech-writers-in-workplace/).

## Podcasts

A third type of post is a podcast. You might choose this option if you'd like to have a conversation and you prefer the spoken exchange, as you might feel it's easier to explain ideas this way. Or you might prefer the more dynamic aspect of podcasts &mdash; by dynamic, I mean your responses might change the questions and direction of the podcast in more natural, spontaneous ways. This kind of dynamic direction isn't always possible through written asynchronous conversation posts.

For podcasts, I'll pretty much prepare the same series of questions as I do in conversation posts, but rather than write your responses, we'll chat through Skype. You'll need some type of microphone for the podcast.

Here's an example of a podcast with Kirk St. Amant on the [relationship between academics and practitioners](/2018/07/11/research-as-bridge-between-academics-and-practitioners-kirk-st-amant-podcast/).

## Individual surveys to follow posts

In order to align and evaluate the goals of the Academic/Practitioner Conversations project, at the end of each post I'll include a survey form that asks the same questions as the [original survey](2018/07/17/interpreting-results-of-academic-practitioner-survey/) but personalized to you. This gives you more direct feedback about your topic or other writing connects or doesn't connect with the practitioner audience. The individual surveys are done through Google Forms. You can see an example [here](http://idratherbewriting.com/2018/07/18/stereotypes-about-tech-writers-in-workplace/#emily).

## Optional sections

At the end of your post (no matter which type), you can include the following information:

*   **Include a brief bio.** Tell us a few sentences about yourself, such as where you live, what program you teach at, what your academic interests are, and what your personal hobbies are. If you spent time working as a practitioner before turning to academia, include that too.
*   **Promote your program.** This is an opportunity for you to promote your tech comm program or other courses available at your university. What's the name of the program, what degree or certificate is offered, and is the program online or in-person? What other details make the program unique?
*   **Invite participation in your research projects.**  If you have a research project where you're looking for companies to participate, or surveys to complete, or other involvement with practitioners, provide the details here and ask readers to participate. Your article might align with practitioner interests such that the practitioner might be willing to collaborate more formally as a data host for the research. Also be sure to sign up for the [Academic/Practitioner Bridge email group](/academic-practitioner-bridge/) for these kinds of collaboration goals.

## Post-publication activities

Publishing the article is just the first step. After the post is published, you can gauge more of the impact of your content. Do the following:

*   **Share the post.** Share the link to your post on Twitter, Linkedin, and any other forums where you participate. Include the hashtag `#techcomm`. You may feel uncomfortable promoting yourself, but don't think of it like this. You're sharing yourself &mdash; your ideas, your research, your contributions to the profession &mdash; with others through these social media links.
*   **Respond to comments.** Make one comment below the article to ensure that you receive email notification of any comments. When people comment, try to respond in some way. People like the interaction, even if the response merely agrees or reflects on their comment.
