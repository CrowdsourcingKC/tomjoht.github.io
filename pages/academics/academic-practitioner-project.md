I'm engaged in a year-long experiment to see if we can change attitudes in the industry that practitioners have toward academics in the same field, and vice versa. By breaking down the barriers that separate the two groups, I hope to encourage more interaction and knowledge sharing between tech comm academics and practitioners.

## Project Overview

For more background around the divide between academics and practitioners, see the November 2016 issue (Volume 63, issue 4) of the [*Technical Communication Journal*](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/stc/tc/2016/00000063/00000004;jsessionid=1g71c4ds12iuv.x-ic-live-01). (The issue is dedicated to this entire topic.) Essentially, although the two groups should be working closely with each other, they operate in independent spheres.

In July 2018, I [published a survey](http://idratherbewriting.com/2018/07/02/survey-for-academics-and-practitioners/) gathering a baseline of attitudes that each group has toward the other. The survey results indicated that practitioners are undecided as to whether academics understand the practitioner workplace issues. The results also indicated that academics aren't writing for practitioners as their primary audience. Both of these results pose serious consequences &mdash; the main consequence being that each group becomes irrelevant to the other. This mutual irrelevance can cripple our progress in the field, since both academics and practitioners need each other to move forward.

I believe we can break down the content barriers between practitioners and academics, and in so doing, help the two groups start to operate in the same sphere. If practitioners could read and provide feedback on research from academics, would this change practitioner attitudes towards academics? Would it deepen their appreciation or would it heighten their disdain for the research academics do? On the flip side, would this increased interaction with practitioners help academics understand their practitioner audience more? Would it sharpen their awareness of real issues, of topics that are relevant and actually in demand in the workplace?

More than 4,500 tech comm professionals subscribe to I'd Rather Be Writing, and the site receives approximately 1,500 hits a day. Each article offers commenting features for discussion, and social media buttons make it easy to share articles. More than any other site, I'd Rather Be Writing is positioned to serve as a communication bridge between academics and practitioners.

## Phases of the project

The Academic/Practitioner Blog project has three simple phases:

* **Phase I**: Capture a baseline of attitudes that each group has toward the other.
* **Phase II**: Saturate practitioners with content from academics through academic guest posts and podcasts.
* **Phase III**: Perform the same survey as in Phase I, looking to see if the increased content moved the scale on any of the attitudes each group has toward the other.

In my surveys, I've decided to measure attitudes, using an agree/disagree spectrum (the Likert approach). I'm hopeful that attitudes can represent more concrete results. A sour attitude likely indicates little interaction or benefit from one group to the other, whereas a glowing attitude indicates a more healthy relationship. At any rate, perhaps something larger will come about from this effort &mdash; I'm not sure.

Overall, a lot has been written about this issue but with little change or effect. Yet, in my mind, the solution doesn't involve rocket science type strategies. You merely publish regular content in the same space in order to achieve some influence. As one of the most well-known and visible people in tech comm &mdash; visibility achieved by publishing regularly on my blog and podcast &mdash; I know how to create influence.

In Phase II, I will try to consume a steady diet of TC academic articles and invite the authors of the articles I read (articles that I deem relevant to the field of tech comm) to contribute [academic guest posts](/academic-guest-post-guidelines/). This stream of academic guest posts on my site will hopefully deepen and enrich the content that practitioners (at least those who try to keep awake and updated in the industry) are exposed to. With each guest post published, I'll include the same survey as before, but focused specifically on the academic author. As practitioners give this feedback, it will give academics (particularly the guest author) clear feedback about how his or her writing matches up with the audience's needs and expectations.

In Phase III (after about a year), I'll evaluate the outcomes. In a best case scenario, the campaign of academic guest posts and podcasts will have contributed to a healthier relationship between the two groups. But even if it solidifies a sense of disdain between the two groups, perhaps poking this bear will cause some actionable outcome to better address the problems.
