More details are coming here, but basically, I plan to launch a series of podcasts focused on academic/practitioner conversations. In these podcasts, I'll interview academics who have published research in academic journals that I find interesting and relevant to tech comm.

The podcasts will be listed in my [regular podcast feed](/category-podcasts/), but they'll also appear here.
