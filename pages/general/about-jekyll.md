[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is the most popular [static site generator](http://staticgen.com) used today. Static site generators are database-free websites that populate all the pages with content before you publish the files on your web server. Jekyll is open source, easy to use, and extremely flexible.

You can use Jekyll to author and publish your help docs instead of using a traditional help authoring tool like Flare, RoboHelp Author-it, or a DITA-based tool such as Oxygen XML. You can do just about everything with Jekyll and more. For more details, see the list of [supported features](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/mydoc_supported_features/). 

Whether you need conditional filtering, content re-use, variables, or even PDF output, you can accomplish it using Jekyll, particularly when using the [Documentation theme for Jekyll](https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/documentation-theme-jekyll) I developed.

If you want to read a series comparing Jekyll with DITA, see the series of posts [here](http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/03/23/new-series-jekyll-versus-dita/). 

For help in setting up and installing the documentation theme, see the [theme's information here](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/).
