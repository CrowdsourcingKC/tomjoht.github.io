## How I increase visibility

idratherbewriting.com is one of the most popular sites where technical writers go to stay updated with the latest technical writing news, trends, and information in the industry. Because of this, I can help increase your product or service's visibility more than any other technical writing site online.

I help increase visibility of your product primarily through **ad impressions**. An impression occurs when someone loads a page where your ad is visible. In 2017, idratherbewriting.com had an average of 845,000 page views, or 2,300 page views a day. Impressions are tracked through Google Analytics.

If you think about it, 2,300 is more people per day than people who attend a tech comm conference. The average page view time is 1:32 minutes.

## Ad space options and costs

Different ad spaces are more visible than others. You can select 3 different spaces:

* [Sidebar ad space](#sidebarad)
* [Horizontal inline ad space](#horizontalinlinead)
* [Top banner ad](#topbannerad)

I also offer [product review posts](#review_posts).

The cost for each ad space is as follows:

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Ad space</th>
        <th>Cost per year</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Sidebar graphic (125 x 125px)</td>
        <td>$900/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Horizontal inline post view (728 x 90px)</td>
        <td>$1,800/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Top Banner space (500 x 70px)</td>
        <td>$6,000/year</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

**CPM**. Here's a breakdown of ad costs in CPM (costs per mille). Assuming 845,000 page views per year, the CPM rate for the sidebar graphic comes out to $1.06 CPM, for the horizontal inline view $2.13 CPM, and for the top banner ad space, $7.10 CPM (cpm = ad cost divided by hits/1,000). These costs align with the [average CPM rates for 2014](http://monetizepros.com/blog/2014/average-cpm-rates/).

## Billing

For billing, I send you an invoice through Paypal. Billing is done prior to any advertising efforts. Although the transaction is through PayPal, you can use either your credit card or PayPal account to submit payment. You can also mail me a check if you prefer.

### Sidebar ad space {#sidebarad}

Sidebar ads (125 x 125px) appear in the left sidebar and randomly rotate positions each time the page refreshes &mdash; this helps refocus the reader's attention on the ads. There is no specific hierarchy to ads in the sidebar.

Your ad can be any image type (JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG) and color, but the dimensions must be 125 x 125 pixels in size. Slow-looping animated GIFs are allowed, but not Flash. You can switch the ad at any time by sending me a new graphic.

<figure>
<img style="border:1px solid #dedede;" title="Sidebar ads" src="/images/ads_sidebar.png" alt="sidebar ads" width="340" height="420" /><figcaption>Sidebar ads appear in the sidebar in a dual column. They rotate randomly with each page refresh.</figcaption></figure>

The cost for sidebar ads is $900 per year.

### Horizontal Inline Ad Space {#horizontalinlinead}

The Horizontal Inline space (728 x 90px) appears below each post, right above the comments, in the single post view. This highly visible space is inline with the reader's eye and provides a natural click-point after a reader finishes reading a post.

<figure><img src="/images/horizontal_inline_ad-550x331.png" alt="horizontal_inline_ad" width="550" height="331" /> <figcaption>Horizontal Inline ads appear at the bottom of each post</figcaption></figure>

Horizontal Inline ads can be JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG. Animated GIF is also allowed. The positions also rotate randomly with each page refresh.

The cost for inline horizontal ads is $1800 per year.

### Top Banner Ad Space {#topbannerad}

The top banner ad space (500 x 70px) refers to the top section of the site, in the upper-right corner.

<figure><img src="/images/top_banner-600x292.png" alt="Top Banner Ad Space" width="600" height="292" /> <figcaption>The Top Banner ad space, which appears at the top of the site, catches the eye of most readers.</figcaption></figure>

The top banner ad is placed in one of the most visually dominant places on the site. Horizontal Inline ads can be JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG. Animated GIF is also allowed.

There is only one ad in the Top Banner ad space, but it can rotate depending on the number of ads in this space.

The cost for top banner ads is $6,000 per year.

### Number of impressions per year

From Jan 1, 2017 to Dec 31, 2017, idratherbewriting.com had about 845,000 page views. Here's a chart from Google Analytics.

<figure><img src="/images/2018googleanalytics.png" alt="I&#039;d Rather Be Writing gets about 845,000 page views per year, or 2,300 page views a day." /> <figcaption>I'd Rather Be Writing gets about 845,066 page views per year, or 2,300 page views a day.</figcaption></figure>

(There was a slight dip mid-year because I split out the [API doc site](http://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/) into a separate Jekyll project and didn't have analytics configured correctly for a while.)

Here's another slice of analytics focusing more on audience:

<figure><img src="/images/2018analyticsuseranalysis.png" alt="Breakdown of analytics" /> <figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{{site.data.alerts.note}} How do "page views" and "sessions" differ? A page view is when the page loads, regardless of whether it's the same visitor or a different visitor. A session refers to a *unique visit* to the site. If the same visitor views 10 pages, it only counts as a single session. The average number of page views per session is 1.58.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

The following table shows a little more detail from Google Analytics (date range is Jan 1 2017 to Dec 31, 2017). These metrics aren't all shown from the above screenshots:

### Quality of impressions

The quality of impressions depends on the influence of the site. Impressions from a highly influential site carry more weight than impressions from a less influential site. MindTouch regularly ranks the most influential people in tech comm. They have consistently named in their top influencers lists since they started publishing reports.

## Product review posts {#review_posts}

I also offer product review posts to help with visibility. Here are some sample product reviews I wrote previously:

* [MadCap Central -- a first look at MadCap’s new cloud-based collaboration and publishing solution](http://idratherbewriting.com/2017/01/16/madcap-central-review/) (1,560 page views in 2017)
* [The Story of Paligo: A new browser-based CCMS with all the features you'd ever want](http://idratherbewriting.com/2016/08/01/paligo-the-story-xml-ccms-in-the-cloud/) (1,250 page views in 2017)
* [Simplified Technical English and HyperSTE](http://idratherbewriting.com/2017/01/25/hyperste-simplified-technical-english-asd-ste100/) (2260 page views in 2017)
* [Evaluating Adobe FrameMaker's responsive HTML5 output](http://idratherbewriting.com/2017/01/16/adobe-framemaker-html5-mobile-responsive-view/) (810 page views in 2017)
* [Adobe FrameMaker 2017 -- time, tools, and the tech writer’s focus on content](http://idratherbewriting.com/2017/03/06/adobe-framemaker-2017-doc-time-and-tools/) (1,170 page views in 2017)

Product review posts are typically 800-1,000 words long and ideally focus on features in a new release. (Having something newsworthy to write about helps establish the article as relevant.)

These review posts aren't merely marketing material converted into a blog post. I try to put a personal spin on posts to connect with my audience. A product review post typically takes 3-4 hours to write.

If possible, I'll download and explore your product before writing about it. But I don't have unlimited time to ramp up to an expert level on your product. I try to draw upon my industry insight and perspective to make insightful points. You'll also probably supply me with the information and messages you want to communicate.

Each product review post costs $500 per post. I will write as many product review posts as you want during the year.

I always review these posts with you and, when published, I identify them as being sponsored posts.

Product review posts have powerful results with search results. If you search google for [Xeditor][google-xeditor], [HyperSTE][google-hyperste], [Paligo][google-paligo], or [Madcap Central][google-madcap-central], you'll see that my product review posts appear on the **first page of search results**. This is because my site has a high page rank and influence.

I also infuse the posts with SEO techniques when I write them. Almost no one else in the tech comm industry has as much online influence as I do with idratherbewriting.com.
