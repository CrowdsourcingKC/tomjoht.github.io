If so, I can help increase your product or service's visibility more than any other tech comm site online. 

I have one of the largest hubs where technical writers gather and interact to stay updated with the latest technical writing news, trends, and information in the industry.

## How I increase visibility

I help increase visibility of your product primarily through ad impressions. An impression occurs when someone loads a page where your ad is visible. Different ad spaces are more visible than others. You can select from among 3 different ad spaces. Impressions are tracked through Google Analytics.

### Sidebar ad space

Sidebar ads (125px x 125px) appear in the left sidebar and randomly rotate positions each time the page refreshes &mdash; this helps refocus the reader's attention on the ads. There is no specific hierarchy to ads in the sidebar.

Your ad can be any image type (JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG) and color, but the dimensions must be exactly 125 x 125 pixels in size. Slow-looping animated GIFs are allowed, but not Flash. You can switch the ad at any time by sending me a new graphic.

### Horizontal Inline Ad Space

The Horizontal Inline space (728px x 90px) appears below each post, right above the comments, in the single post view. This highly visible space is inline with the reader's eye and provides a natural click-point after a reader finishes reading a post.

Horizontal Inline ads can be JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG. Animated GIF is also allowed. The positions also rotate randomly with each page refresh.

### Top Banner Ad Space

The top banner ad space (500px x 70px) refers to the top section of the site, in the upper-right corner.

The top banner ad is placed in one of the most visually dominant places on the site. Horizontal Inline ads can be JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG. Animated GIF is also allowed. 

There is only one ad in the Top Banner ad space, but it can rotate depending on the number of ads in this space. 

### Number of impressions per year

### Quality of impressions

The quality of impressions depends on the influence of the site. Impressions from a highly influential site carry more weight than impressions from a less influential site.

### Costs for ads

The cost for each ad space is as follows:

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Ad space</th>
        <th>Cost per year</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Sidebar graphic (125px x 125px)</td>
        <td>$900/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Horizontal inline post view (728px x 90px)</td>
        <td>$1,800/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Top Banner space (500px x 70px)</td>

**CPM**. Here's a breakdown of ad costs in CPM (costs per mille).
