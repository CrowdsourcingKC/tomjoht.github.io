## Ad space options and costs

<img style="float:right; padding-left:15px;" src="/images/ads/youradhere.png" alt="advertising on I'd Rather Be Writing"/>

I mainly help increase visibility of your product primarily through **ad impressions**. An impression occurs when someone loads a page where your ad is visible. In 2018, idratherbewriting.com had an average of 1,552,615 page views, or about 4,250 page views a day. Users created 942,306 sessions, with 1.65 pages per session and an average of 1:44 minutes per session. Analytics are tracked through Google Analytics. More analytics details are provided below in [Site traffic analytics for 2018](#site_traffic).

You can advertise your product or service on idratherbewriting.com. Different ad spaces are more visible than others. You can select from several different spaces or services:

* [Sidebar ad space](#sidebarad)
* [Horizontal inline ad space](#horizontalinlinead)
* [Top banner ad](#topbannerad)
* [Newsletter space](#newsletterspace)
* [Inline text blurbs](#inline_text_blurbs)
* [Product review posts](#product_review_posts)
* [Podcasts](#podcasts)
* [Guest posts](#guest_posts)

The cost for each ad space is as follows:

<table>
<colgroup>
   <col width="30%" />
   <col width="20%" />
   <col width="40%" />
</colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr>

For billing, I usually send you an invoice through Paypal. Billing is done prior to any advertising efforts. Although the transaction is through PayPal, you can use either your credit card or PayPal account to submit payment. You can also mail me a check if you prefer.

## Sidebar ad space {#sidebarad}

Sidebar ads (125 x 125px) appear in the left sidebar and randomly rotate positions each time the page refreshes &mdash; this helps refocus the reader's attention on the ads. There is no specific hierarchy to ads in the sidebar.

Your ad can be any image type (JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG) and color; the dimensions must be 125 x 125 pixels in size. Slow-looping animated GIFs are allowed, but not Flash. You can switch the ad at any time by sending me a new graphic.

<figure>
<img style="border:1px solid #dedede;" title="Sidebar ads" src="/images/ads_sidebar.png" alt="sidebar ads" max-width="340"/><figcaption>Sidebar ads appear in the sidebar in a dual column. They rotate randomly with each page refresh.</figcaption></figure>

The cost for sidebar ads is $1,000 per year. (Shorter advertising durations aren't allowed.)

## Horizontal Inline Ad Space {#horizontalinlinead}

The Horizontal Inline space (728 x 90px) appears below each post, right above the comments, in the single post view. This highly visible space is inline with the reader's eye and provides a natural click-point after a reader finishes reading a post.

<figure><img src="/images/horizontal_inline_ad-550x331.png" alt="horizontal_inline_ad" max-width="550" /> <figcaption>Horizontal Inline ads appear at the bottom of each post</figcaption></figure>

Horizontal Inline ads can be JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG. Animated GIF is also allowed. Like the sidebar, the position of the horizontal inline ads rotate randomly with each page refresh. There is no limit to the number of horizontal inline post ads. The cost for inline horizontal ads is $2,000 per year.

## Top Banner Ad Space {#topbannerad}

The top banner ad space (400 x 60px) refers to the top section of the site, in the upper-right corner. The top banner ad is placed in one of the most visually dominant places on the site.

<figure><img src="/images/top_banner-600x292.png" alt="Top Banner Ad Space" max-width="600" /> <figcaption>The Top Banner ad space, which appears at the top of the site, catches the eye of most readers.</figcaption></figure>

Top banner ads can be JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG. Animated GIFs aren't allowed. There is only one ad in the Top Banner ad space per advertiser, but it can rotate depending on the number of ads you want to put in this space. For example, if you have three top banner ads, the ads can rotate in this space with each page refresh. The cost for top banner ads is $6,000 per year.

## Newsletter Space {#newsletterspace}

I send out 4 newsletters a month (one per week) to all my email subscribers (4,750+ readers). These newsletters contain links and excerpts to the latest posts (there are usually two posts per newsletter). Usually, each blog post in the newsletter gets around 300 clicks, and the advertising graphic receives approximately 60 clicks. The size of the newsletter graphic is 600 x 70px graphic. Here's an [example](https://tinyletter.com/tomjoht/letters/new-posts-on-i-d-rather-be-writing-59):

<figure><img src="/images/newsletterspace.png" alt="Newsletter space ad" style="max-width: 600px"><figcaption>The newsletter ad space has some of the most visibility and reach, especially for regular readers. You can see the <a href='https://tinyletter.com/tomjoht/archive'>newsletter archive here</a>.</figcaption></figure>

The image format can be any standard image format (JPG, PNG, GIF), but not animated. The cost for advertising in the newsletter space is $1,500 per year. Shorter advertising durations aren't allowed.

{% comment %}
Additionally, once a month I allow a more expanded product feature focus. This product feature can include an expanded graphic section with other details in a more more full-featured way. The newsletter mailing will still start out with a couple of links and excerpts from I'd Rather Be Writing but then transition into your centerpiece focus. Here's an example:

<figure><a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/images/samplenewsletterfeature.png"><img src="/images/samplenewsletterfeature.png" alt="Newsletter product feature" style="max-width: 600px"></a><figcaption>The product feature provides your creative HTML content in a more attention-getting way.</figcaption></figure>
{% endcomment %}

## Inline text blurbs {#inline_text_blurbs}

Inline text blurbs are short snippets of text, about 1-3 sentences in length (or 140 characters), that appear in random positions on every page of my [API documentation site](/learnapidoc/). You can define 10 ad blurbs with the variety of content and links you want. Here's an example:

{% include random_ad.html %}

The text blurb's text changes randomly with each page refresh. However, the position of the blurb on the page remains in the same (initially random) location.

The in-text ads are denoted with a Bootstrap alert-type formatting, with text that says “Sponsored message” prefacing the ad. Pages not included are contact, search, error, or other non-content pages. A maximum of 3 inline blurbs can appear on each page. Cost for inline text blurbs to appear on the API doc site is $3,000 per year.

## Product review posts {#review_posts}

I also offer product review posts to help with visibility. To write this post, I usually have a 20-30 minute phone call with you to find out what message you want to share. Here are some sample product reviews I wrote previously:

* [MadCap Central -- a first look at MadCap’s new cloud-based collaboration and publishing solution](https://idratherbewriting.com/2017/01/16/madcap-central-review/) (1,560 page views in 2017)
* [The Story of Paligo: A new browser-based CCMS with all the features you'd ever want](https://idratherbewriting.com/2016/08/01/paligo-the-story-xml-ccms-in-the-cloud/) (1,250 page views in 2017)
* [Simplified Technical English and HyperSTE](https://idratherbewriting.com/2017/01/25/hyperste-simplified-technical-english-asd-ste100/) (2260 page views in 2017)
* [Evaluating Adobe FrameMaker's responsive HTML5 output](https://idratherbewriting.com/2017/01/16/adobe-framemaker-html5-mobile-responsive-view/) (810 page views in 2017)
* [Adobe FrameMaker 2017 -- time, tools, and the tech writer’s focus on content](https://idratherbewriting.com/2017/03/06/adobe-framemaker-2017-doc-time-and-tools/) (1,170 page views in 2017)

Product review posts are typically 800-1,000 words long and ideally focus on features in a new release. (Having something newsworthy to write about helps establish the article as relevant.)

These review posts aren't merely marketing material converted into a blog post. I try to put a personal spin on posts to connect with my audience. A product review post typically takes 3-4 hours to write.

If possible, I'll download and explore your product before writing about it. But I don't have unlimited time to ramp up to an expert level on your product. I try to draw upon my industry insight and perspective to make insightful points. You'll also probably supply me with the information and messages you want to communicate.

Each product review post costs $500 per post. I always review these posts with you and, when published, I identify them as being sponsored posts. If desired, you can also write the post.

Product review posts have powerful results with search results. If you search google for [Xeditor][google-xeditor], [HyperSTE][google-hyperste], [Paligo][google-paligo], or [Madcap Central][google-madcap-central], you'll see that my product review posts appear on the **first page of search results**. This is because my site has a high page rank and influence.

I also infuse the posts with SEO techniques when I write them. Almost no one else in the tech comm industry has as much online influence as I do with idratherbewriting.com.


## Guest posts {#guest_posts}

If you advertise your product or service on my site, I allow you to contribute one guest post per year. You write the guest post yourself, though I might edit it for style. Guest posts are typically 800-1,000 words long and ideally focus on features in a new release. (Having something newsworthy to write about helps establish the article as relevant.)

These guest posts shouldn't merely marketing material converted into a blog post. Try to put a personal spin on your post to connect with the audience. Product review posts have powerful results with search results. If you search google for [Xeditor][google-xeditor], [HyperSTE][google-hyperste], [Paligo][google-paligo], or [Madcap Central][google-madcap-central], you'll see some of these review posts appear on the **first page of search results**. This is because my site has a high page rank and influence.

You can also infuse the posts with SEO techniques when you write them. Almost no one else in the tech comm industry has as much online influence as idratherbewriting.com.

If you don't purchase any other advertising, the cost for a guest post is $300 per post. Guest posts always include notes that they are sponsored posts.

## Podcasts {#podcasts}

Podcasts are 30-minute audio conversations that are recorded and distributed as on-demand audio files. If you'd like your company or product to be featured in a podcast, this format can help listeners get a better sense of your personality and story. Podcasts might not have as many hits as online readers, but those who do listen to podcasts feel a stronger connection with the hosts and story than with written posts.

To prepare for podcasts, I send you about 10 questions focused on the product or service that you want highlighted. The podcast length is typically 20-30 minutes and syndicated out on iTunes, Stitcher, and other channels. The cost is $300 per podcast.
