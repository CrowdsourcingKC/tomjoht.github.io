## Ad space options and costs

I mainly help increase visibility of your product primarily through **ad impressions**. An impression occurs when someone loads a page where your ad is visible. In 2018, idratherbewriting.com had an average of 1,552,615 page views, or about 4,250 page views a day. Users created 942,306 sessions, with 1.65 pages per session and an average of 1:44 minutes per session. Analytics are tracked through Google Analytics. More analytics details are provided below in [Site traffic analytics for 2018](#site_traffic).

You can advertise your product or service on idratherbewriting.com. Different ad spaces are more visible than others. You can select from several different spaces or services:

* [Sidebar ad space](#sidebarad)
* [Horizontal inline ad space](#horizontalinlinead)
* [Top banner ad](#topbannerad)
* [Newsletter space](#newsletterspace)
* [Inline text blurbs](#inline_text_blurbs)
* [Guest posts](#guest_posts)

The cost for each ad space is as follows:

<table>
<colgroup>
   <col width="30%" />
   <col width="20%" />
   <col width="40%" />
</colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Ad space</th>
        <th>Size</th>
        <th>Cost per year</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td markdown="span">[Sidebar graphic](#sidebarad)</td>
        <td markdown="span">125 x 125px</td>
        <td markdown="span">$1,000/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td markdown="span">[Top Banner space](#topbannerad)</td>
        <td markdown="span">400 x 60px</td>
        <td markdown="span">$7,000/year</td>
    </tr>

        <td markdown="span">400 x 60px</td>
        <td markdown="span">$1,500/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td markdown="span">[Inline text blurbs](#inline_text_blurbs)</td>
        <td markdown="span">1-2 sentences</td>
        <td markdown="span">$2,000/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td markdown="span">[Guest post](#guest_posts)</td>
        <td markdown="span">500-1,000 words</td>
        <td markdown="span">One per year free with other advertising purchases</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

For billing, I usually send you an invoice through Paypal. Billing is done prior to any advertising efforts. Although the transaction is through PayPal, you can use either your credit card or PayPal account to submit payment. You can also mail me a check if you prefer.

### Sidebar ad space {#sidebarad}

Sidebar ads (125 x 125px) appear in the left sidebar and randomly rotate positions each time the page refreshes &mdash; this helps refocus the reader's attention on the ads. There is no specific hierarchy to ads in the sidebar.

Your ad can be any image type (JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG) and color; the dimensions must be 125 x 125 pixels in size. Slow-looping animated GIFs are allowed, but not Flash. You can switch the ad at any time by sending me a new graphic.

<figure>
<img style="border:1px solid #dedede;" title="Sidebar ads" src="/images/ads_sidebar.png" alt="sidebar ads" max-width="340"/><figcaption>Sidebar ads appear in the sidebar in a dual column. They rotate randomly with each page refresh.</figcaption></figure>

The cost for sidebar ads is $1,000 per year. (Shorter advertising durations aren't allowed.)

### Horizontal Inline Ad Space {#horizontalinlinead}

The Horizontal Inline space (728 x 90px) appears below each post, right above the comments, in the single post view. This highly visible space is inline with the reader's eye and provides a natural click-point after a reader finishes reading a post.

<figure><img src="/images/horizontal_inline_ad-550x331.png" alt="horizontal_inline_ad" max-width="550" /> <figcaption>Horizontal Inline ads appear at the bottom of each post</figcaption></figure>

Horizontal Inline ads can be JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG. Animated GIF is also allowed. Like the sidebar, the position of the horizontal inline ads rotate randomly with each page refresh. There is no limit to the number of horizontal inline post ads. The cost for inline horizontal ads is $2,000 per year.

### Top Banner Ad Space {#topbannerad}

The top banner ad space (400 x 60px) refers to the top section of the site, in the upper-right corner. The top banner ad is placed in one of the most visually dominant places on the site.

<figure><img src="/images/top_banner-600x292.png" alt="Top Banner Ad Space" max-width="600" /> <figcaption>The Top Banner ad space, which appears at the top of the site, catches the eye of most readers.</figcaption></figure>

Top banner ads can be JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG. Animated GIFs aren't allowed. There is only one ad in the Top Banner ad space per advertiser, but it can rotate depending on the number of ads you want to put in this space. For example, if you have three top banner ads, the ads can rotate in this space with each page refresh. The cost for top banner ads is $7,000 per year.

### Newsletter Space {#newsletterspace}

I send out 4 newsletters a month (one per week) to all my email subscribers (4,750+ readers). These newsletters contain links and excerpts to the latest posts (there are usually two posts per newsletter). Usually, each blog post in the newsletter gets around 300 clicks, and the advertising graphic receives approximately 60 clicks. The size of the newsletter graphic is 600 x 70px graphic. Here's an [example](https://tinyletter.com/tomjoht/letters/new-posts-on-i-d-rather-be-writing-59):

<figure><img src="/images/newsletterspace.png" alt="Newsletter space ad" style="max-width: 600px"><figcaption>The newsletter ad space has some of the most visibility and reach, especially for regular readers. You can see the <a href='https://tinyletter.com/tomjoht/archive'>newsletter archive here</a>.</figcaption></figure>

The image format can be any standard image format (JPG, PNG, GIF), but not animated. The cost for advertising in the newsletter space is $1,500 per year. Shorter advertising durations aren't allowed.

{% comment %}
Additionally, once a month I allow a more expanded product feature focus. This product feature can include an expanded graphic section with other details in a more more full-featured way. The newsletter mailing will still start out with a couple of links and excerpts from I'd Rather Be Writing but then transition into your centerpiece focus. Here's an example:

<figure><a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/images/samplenewsletterfeature.png"><img src="/images/samplenewsletterfeature.png" alt="Newsletter product feature" style="max-width: 600px"></a><figcaption>The product feature provides your creative HTML content in a more attention-getting way.</figcaption></figure>
{% endcomment %}

### Inline text blurbs {#inline_text_blurbs}

Inline text blurbs are short snippets of text, about 1-3 sentences in length (or 140 characters), that appear in random positions on every page of the my [API documentation site](/learnapidoc/). Here's an example:

{% include random_ad.html %}

The text blurb's text changes randomly with each page refresh. However, the position of the blurb on the page remains the same (based on where I randomly insert the tag on each page). You can define 10 ad blurbs with the variety of content and links you want.

The in-text ads are denoted with a Bootstrap alert-type formatting, with text that says “Sponsored message” prefacing the ad. Pages not included are contact, search, error, or other non-content pages. Cost for inline text blurbs to appear on the API documentation site is $2,000 per year.

### Guest posts {#guest_posts}

If you advertise your product or service on my site, I allow you to contribute one guest post per year. You write the guest post yourself, though I might edit it for style. Guest posts are typically 800-1,000 words long and ideally focus on features in a new release. (Having something newsworthy to write about helps establish the article as relevant.)

These guest posts aren't merely marketing material converted into a blog post. Try to put a personal spin on your post to connect with the audience. Product review posts have powerful results with search results. If you search google for [Xeditor][google-xeditor], [HyperSTE][google-hyperste], [Paligo][google-paligo], or [Madcap Central][google-madcap-central], you'll see some of these review posts appear on the **first page of search results**. This is because my site has a high page rank and influence.

You can also infuse the posts with SEO techniques when you write them. Almost no one else in the tech comm industry has as much online influence as idratherbewriting.com.

## Site traffic analytics for 2018 {#site_traffic}

Here's a breakdown of site traffic analytics on idratherbewriting.com from Jan 1, 2018, to Dec 31, 2018. I use Google Analytics to track traffic.

<figure><img src="/images/googleanalytics2019-overall.png"  alt="I&#039;d Rather Be Writing received 1,552,615 page views during 2018, or 4,253 page views a day." /> <figcaption>I'd Rather Be Writing gets about 1,552,615 page views per year, or 4,253 page views a day.</figcaption></figure>

Here's another slice of analytics focusing more on audience:

<figure><img src="/images/google-analytics2019-audience.png" alt="Breakdown of analytics" /> <figcaption>Here you can see a breakdown of sessions. During 2018, there were about 942,000 sessions, with users viewing 1.65 pages per session. </figcaption></figure>

{{site.data.alerts.note}}How do "page views" and "sessions" differ? A page view is when the page loads, regardless of whether it's the same visitor or a different visitor. A session refers to a *unique visit* to the site. If the same visitor views 10 pages, it only counts as a single session. The average number of pages per session is 1.65.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

The following table shows a little more detail from Google Analytics (the date range is Jan 1, 2018 to Dec 31, 2018). These metrics aren't all shown from the above screenshots:

### Quality of impressions

The quality of impressions depends on the influence of the site. Impressions from a highly influential site carry more weight than impressions from a less influential site. MindTouch previously tracked top influencers in tech comm (lately they've shifted to "customer success"instead of teach comm). Links to previous rankings are below.
