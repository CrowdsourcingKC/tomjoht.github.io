<p>If you have question you would like help with, you can subscribe to the Technical Writing Mentors mailing list to submit your question. This list is new but will eventually include a lot of professionals, academics, other others willing to give advice and guidance about the technical communication profession. You can subscribe to the group by adding your email address in the box below and clicking Subscribe.</p>
<p>The most common questions I receive on this blog are how people to break into technical writing, especially if you're a student or are transitioning from another career. See information about pursuing technical communication as a career, see the <a title="beginner tips on breaking into technical writing" href="http://idratherbewriting.com/category/beginner-tips/">Beginner Tips category</a>.</p>
