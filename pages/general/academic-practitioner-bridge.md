## What is this bridge?

Tech Comm practitioners and academics are like two sides of a coin. Practitioners need academics in order to move past perceptions of simply being word technicians, where writing is viewed as a commodity that can easily be performed by anyone. Likewise, academics look to do research to advance the tech comm field, but they need practitioner input for data, relevance, and workplace understanding. Both groups need each other, but there's no clear mechanism for each for communication between the two groups.

## What information will appear in this space

In this space, I hope to help bridge this gap in the following way:

* Practitioners can post questions they want answers to from academics. For example, is a two-column or three-column layout more effective? What is the right design with API docs for a developer audience?

* Academics can post questions about the research projects they're undertaking. For example, is data available for a study about user metrics that are used in reporting? Are practitioners interested in learning more about effective integration in agile?

You can use the discussion thread below to start conversations. You can also [email me](http://idratherbewriting.com/contact/) with the information, and I'll post it here.

As discussions develop, I'll periodically add them here in a more formal way.
