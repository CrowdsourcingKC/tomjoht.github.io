<p><strong>This page is under construction.</strong></p>
<p>Swagger provides a specification that various tools can use to generate REST API doc in an interactive UI interface. Swagger is described as both a specification and a framework, which is somewhat vague. It's vague because Swagger can be implemented in a variety of ways and within a lot of different platforms and languages. You can incorporate this syntax in your actual code (particular to a specific language). Or you can create a YAML file that follows a particular syntax that the Swagger-UI parser can process.</p>
<p>With the latter method, it's kind of like DITA, in that you have a syntax that you format content with, and then various tools can parse that syntax and render it into an output.</p>
<p>There's an online editor you can use to create a Swagger YAML file in the correct syntax. You can use the Swagger editor at <a href="http://editor.swagger.io/#/edit">http://editor.swagger.io/#/edit</a>. You can also run this editor locally by following the <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor">instructions here</a>. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor">Swagger editor project page</a>.</p>
<p>Not sure, but I think you follow the instructions here to generate the files from your local machine: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/develop_2.0.</p>
<p>Or maybe here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui</p>
<p>I suggest taking at look at the codegen version for swagger spec 2.0 from here:</p>
<p>https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen/tree/develop_2.0</p>
<p>And the templates that are used for static html:</p>
