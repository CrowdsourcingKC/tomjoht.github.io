<p>REST APIs are often called "web APIs" because they use the same protocol as the web to transfer information. When you make a specific web request, you get a particular response.</p>
<p>Most of the examples require an authentication key of some kind. This helps companies protect from people making millions of requests that take down their servers, because at any point they can turn off an API key and the requests will be ignored. Additionally, the authentication key allows companies to track and charge users based on how much they use an API.</p>
<p>Here are several examples in using a REST API:</p>
