## My transition into API docs
- first API doc was for a startup in silicon valley that made gamification APIs
- what's different: developer audience, material (no GUI), emphasis on code (which i had to learn) 
- result of main task is that you just get a little packet of information returned

## Different kinds of APIs
- tech landscape is wide, diverse 
- two main kinds: plaform-specific APIs, and REST APIs
- REST APIs are most popular. you can see graph of them taking off

## Documentation is extremely important element in APIs
- clear and accurate docs most important aspect

## Publishing is one value tech writers can add
- problem is dev doc is really complicated
- without programming bg, can be a bit daunting
- one of the key roles tech writers can play is to facilitate the publishing of the information that devs write. this can be one of your value adds -- you edit the info, make it look pretty, accessible, navigable, etc.

## Focus here on publishing strategies, not intro to APIs
- not an introduction
- plenty of other talks for that
- focusing on publishing
- focus more on REST APIs than platform specific APIs
