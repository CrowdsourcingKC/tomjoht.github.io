## The focus here is on publishing

This API course has a specific focus: publishing strategies for API documentation. If you're new to APIs, first see my course <a href="{{ "/restapicourse" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">REST API Course</a>. 

## API docs have incredible variety

Nothing has so much variety in tech docs as API documentation. Almost no API doc set is the same. Whereas many tech comm outputs are recognizable to a specific tool, such as a Madcap Flare output, a Framemaker output, or an Author-it output, it's hard to attribute an API doc set to a particular tool.

If dividing API docs into categories, there are probably 3 main categories of publishing:

* Document generators from source code
* Custom websites
* Help authoring tools

## My approach is to identify key trends and patterns

My approach in this presentation is to identify some key trends and patterns with API documentation publishing. Rather than focusing on specific tools, I want to look at common themes or techniques in outputs. You can do similar things with a lot of different tools.

## 50 APIs

As a sample size, I gathered 50 of the top APIs published on the web. In this presentation, I'm focusing on web API documentation, mainly REST APIs, rather than also looking at document generator solutions (such as Javadoc or Doxygen).
