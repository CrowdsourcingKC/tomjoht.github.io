## What are API lifecycle sites

There are a number of API platforms thare I'm calling "API lifecycle sites." These are sites that allow you to host your API, control access to it, manage authorization keys, and publish documentation. They're basically all-in-one platforms for your API.

There are several of these platforms:

* [Apiary](https://apiary.io/): Publish documentation following API Blueprint
* [Mulesoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/): Publish documentation following RAML using the API Designer editor
* [Restlet Studio](http://studio.restlet.com/#/)
