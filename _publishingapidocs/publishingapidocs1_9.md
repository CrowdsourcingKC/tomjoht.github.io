## Beautiful API doc sites require front-end design skills

If you want to build a beautiful API doc website that rivals sites such as [Parse.com](http://parse.com) and others, you'll most likely need to involve a UX engineer to build it. Fortunately, this is a solution that many UX engineers and other web developers are usually excited to tackle.

## When it makes sense to partner with UX

If you want to integrate your API documentation into your main website, ask the person designing your main website for strategies on integrating the doc site into it. This integration might allow you to leverage authentication (if needed) and other interaction points (such as with forums or support tickets). 

## Web platform languages 

Many custom websites are built using a variety of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS tools. Most likely you'll be able to supply a batch of Markdown or HTML files to the web developer to integrate.
