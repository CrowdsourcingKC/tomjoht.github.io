## Three kinds of API doc elements

<blockquote>
Reference: This is the listing of all the functionality in excruciating detail. This includes all datatype and function specs. Your advanced developers will leave this open in a tab all day long.
Guides: This is somewhere between the reference and tutorials. It should be like your reference with prose that explains how to use your API.
Tutorials: These teach your users specific things that they can do with your API, and are usually tightly focused on just a few pieces of functionality. Bonus points if you include working sample code.</blockquote> &mdash; from [Parse](http://blog.parse.com/learn/engineering/designing-great-api-docs/)

- parse blog post breaks them down this way. 
- reference
- guides
- tutorials

In Mulesoft's API tooling, you can see how they have these sections as a template for each API:

## Guides
- regular how-to content
- some common sections

## Tutorials
- not hardcore elearning
- parallels to a hello world in programming or app development doc

## Reference
- mostly details about the endpoints
- highly structured
- if engineers write anything, it'll be the reference doc
- parameters with endpoints in detail
- meant to be browsed. not a starting point in the doc
