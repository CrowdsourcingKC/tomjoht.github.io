If you want to encourage engineers to write documentation, integrate your writing tools and process into their toolchain and workflow.

## Write the Docs video
If you work with developer documentation, definitely check out Riona Macnamara's Write the Docs 2015 presentation: Documentation, Disrupted: How two technical writers changed Google engineering culture.

## The problem: Scattered documentation
Riona Macnamara is a technical writer at Google. Riona says that several years ago, internal documentation at Google was scattered across wikis, Google Sites, Google Docs, and other places.

In surveys at Google about the workplace, many employees said the inability to find accurate, up-to-date documentation was one of the biggest pain points.

Despite Google's excellence in organizing the world's information, organizing it internally proved to be difficult.

## Moving doc into engineering workflows
Riona says they helped solve the problem by integrating documentation into the engineer's workflow. Rather than trying to force-fit writer tools onto engineers, they fit the documentation into developer tools.

Developers now write documentation in Markdown files in the same repository as their code. Some other engineers wrote a script to display these Markdown files in a browser directly from the code repository.

The method quickly gained traction, with hundreds of developer projects quickly adopting the new method. Now instead of authoring documentation in a separate system, developers simply add the doc in the same repository as the code. This ensures that anyone who is using the code can also find the documentation.

Engineers can either read the documentation directly in the Markdown source, or they can read it displayed in a browser.
