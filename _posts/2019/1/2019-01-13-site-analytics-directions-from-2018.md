Every year when I re-examine my site analytics, I take the time to reflect on trends I’m seeing with my own site. Not necessarily industry trends, just trends about which topics are popular based on my site. Based on these trends, I assess and re-evaluate some of my directions.

Here's a breakdown of site traffic analytics on idratherbewriting.com from Jan 1, 2018, to Dec 31, 2018 based on Google Analytics:

<figure><img src="/images/googleanalytics2019-overall.png"  alt="I&#039;d Rather Be Writing received 1,552,615 page views during 2018, or 4,253 page views a day." /> <figcaption>I'd Rather Be Writing gets about 1,552,615 page views per year, or 4,253 page views a day.</figcaption></figure>

Here's another slice of analytics focusing more on audience:

<figure><img src="/images/google-analytics2019-audience.png" alt="Breakdown of analytics" /> <figcaption>Here you can see a breakdown of sessions. During 2018, there were about 942,000 sessions, with users viewing 1.65 pages per session. </figcaption></figure>

{{site.data.alerts.note}}How do "page views" and "sessions" differ? A page view is when the page loads, regardless of whether it's the same visitor or a different visitor. A session refers to a *unique visit* to the site. If the same visitor views 10 pages, it only counts as a single session. The average number of page views per session is 1.65.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

The following table shows a little more detail (the date range is Jan 1, 2018 to Dec 31, 2018). These metrics aren't all shown from the above screenshots:

### Age and gender

The breakdown of audience age and gender is as follows:

<figure><img src="/images/googleanalytics-age-and-gender.png" alt="Age and gender breakdown" /> <figcaption></figcaption>There are twice as many males as females reading my site. This demographic reflects the more male-centric programmer culture, </figure>

In years past, the gender distribution was more balanced. But with more traffic coming in through my API documentation site, the more predominant male audience reflects the gender imbalance in the programming culture. This suggests that many of my readers are engineers rather than technical writers.

## Drawing conclusions from analytics

Based on these analytics, what conclusions can we draw? Here a few ideas.

Most traffic is coming in to the API documentation site, so I should continue to work on and develop the content there. Just because the content isn't in the form of blog posts, it doesn't mean traffic is any less. I worked a ton on the content there &mdash; incremental updates, refinements, re-organization, and more. I spent as much time working on that content as on my regular blog, but look at the differences in traffic. Only 4.42% of traffic to my site comes in through blog posts written in 2018, whereas 58.8% of the traffic comes in through the API documentation site. 1.28% comes in through my [Simplifying Complexity](/simplifying-complexity) site. The increased traffic on my API documentation site grew my page views from 845,066 in 2017 to 1,552,615 in 2018, which is nearly double! This lopsidedness in traffic has given me a lot to think about.

That said, I think the engineering audience who comes to the API documentation site is less likely to comment, subscribe, and become regular readers. The bump in newsletter subscribers doesn't necessarily reflect double the traffic.

Some efforts that didn't have much success include the [Simplifying Complexity](/simplifying-complexity) site and the [Academic Practitioner collaboration project](https://idratherbewriting.com/academic-practitioner-project/). Low traffic and page views for this content suggests that I should discontinue (or at least de-emphasize) these efforts.

I posted [video recordings of the two API workshops](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_course_videos.html) I gave (in Denver and Menlo Park) this year. There were 4,691 views on YouTube for the collective videos.

Let's reflect on a theme I wrote about in [What technical writing trends will we see in 2018?](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/01/02/technical-writing-trends-2018-and-2017-review/). I said,

> What will 2018 bring for the field of tech comm? Here’s what I think. In 2018, tech writers will play more cross-functional, interdisciplinary roles in order to establish value as generalists.” this is because knowledge domain becoming more specialized, forcing writers to play more of an editing/publishing role. Not really sure. Research on trends shows continued desire for subject-matter familiarity.

And also this:

> Yet, here’s what I don’t understand. If the world is becoming more complex due to increased specialization, why don’t we see an increased demand for people who can simplify this complexity? Why aren’t technical writers the hottest and most sought-after role in the technology industry?”

Looking at my metrics, I think there's some truth to my observations. If a lot more engineers are searching for and consuming information on API documentation, it suggests that engineers are writing documentation, rather than technical writers. This trend reinforces the idea that technical writers are becoming more generalists and engineers are handling more specialized documentation topics such as API documentation.

If that weren't the case, why would so many engineers be landing on my site? I could be wrong about the demographic &mdash; maybe the traffic represents the hoards of technical writers trying to transition into the API documentation space. That surely reflects some percentage of the users, but given the drastic gender imbalance in the metrics, it would be hard to argue that many of the users *aren't* engineers. The gender balance in the tech comm demographic is much more balanced, and in years past (before my API documentation site), there was even a greater number of female readers.

So based on these metrics, my guess is that more engineers are writing API docs. Given that the 2017 Bureau of Labor Statistics data says that only "10" technical writer jobs were added to the U.S. economy, it further reinforces the idea that more engineers are writing docs. Docs-as-code has flourished as a standard approach to writing and publishing documentation, in part because of the increased engineer-writer audience.

I wrote and focused on trends a lot this year. I argued that the increased amount of specialization means more engineers will be writing docs &mdash; because the content is so specialized, it exceeds the capacity of tech writers (typically generalists) to cover it. As a result, tech writers need to get more skilled at collaborating with engineers to elicit the needed information.

Based on this traffic, I might further refine my trends post and perhaps return to this earlier point:

> However much I dislike the model where engineers develop content and technical writers add information usability, this just might be the norm in years to come. If the content is so specialized that only engineers can fully articulate it at the required level, then technical writers will play more supporting editorial roles, guiding engineers with content creation and making the information more readable/usable.
>
> The degree to which engineers collaborate in the documentation process falls along a spectrum, for sure. But I don’t see how we can accommodate increasing amounts of specialization and complexity in the technology landscape without also incorporating more engineers into the writing process. [Embracing a more collaborative role in authoring specialized content](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/10/09/tech-comm-trends-more-collaboration-with-engineers/#embracing-a-more-collaborative-role-in-authoring-specialized-content)

The 2017-2018 Salary Database confirms that technical writing jobs are flat:

<img src="/images/stcsalarydatabase2017flat.png" alt="2017-2018 Salary Database confirms that technical writing jobs are flat" />

But the tech industry is certainly growing. The number of engineers...

This is the trend in the tech comm field: Everything is shifting to API documentation. This graphic pretty much sums it up:

<img src="/images/learnapidocmetrics.png" alt="Metrics show massive shift towards API doc, which also suggests that engineers are writing them" />

In a recent review of my site by Craig Cardimon, Craig wrote,

> I’d Rather Be Writing remains a fantastic resource for new and seasoned technical writers. I admit I visited his site more when Johnson discussed more general technical writing topics regularly. He has migrated toward API programming documentation and producing podcasts, whereas I am still enjoying myself quite a bit as a software technical writer. Still, I bookmarked his site long ago, and visit it whenever I need a refresher or an introduction to topics around the career I love. [Review: Tom Johnson’s “I’d Rather Be Writing” Website](https://techwhirl.com/review-tom-johnsons-id-rather-writing-website/)

I didn't start analyzing my metrics to find ways more evidence for my industry trends arguments. I simply analyze trends every year (for last year's metrics analysis, see [Unexpected realizations after a comprehensive review of my 2017 site metrics](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/01/11/comprehensive-metrics-for-idratherbewriting-in-2017)).

Close on a quote from Cardimon about the shifting industry.
