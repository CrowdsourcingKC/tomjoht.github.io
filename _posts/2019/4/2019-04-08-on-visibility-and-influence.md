summary: "Can the same principles for visibility and influence online lead to visibility and influence inside corporate walls?"
---

One of the paradoxes of my career is to be recognized as a thought leader and influencer on the web among tech comm circles but to feel relatively insignificant and invisible at my place of work. In other words, to be a blogebrity online among the tech comm crowd, but to just be a nameless commoner at work with everyone else. This year I'd like to fix that ... somehow.

Working hypothesis: Surely the same principles of influence and visibility on the web must apply within corporate walls as well, right? I mean, do corporations function so differently from the web? If not, couldn't I use the same basic principles for influence online to wield more influence and visibility at work?

The formula for influence on the web is fairly simple: write content (about a specific topic) and share it with people (interested in that topic). Repeat over and over.

However, there's one key difference (at least with my content) between the web and the corporation: the audience. On the web, I write a blog geared towards others tech comm professionals. I have no visibility or influence outside of this domain. But at work, the people I want to influence aren't other technical writers. I want to influence business leaders &mdash; product managers, field engineers, business developers, support groups, UX, product development, program managers, and more. I have the same influence on business leaders on the web as at work &mdash; that is, not much.

Writing about documentation-related topics won't influence business leaders much, as their interests focus on other matters with other priorities. But there is one common topic that overlaps across discipline lines, whether your focus is documentation or product revenues or other matters: **the customer experience**. No matter what your department, almost everyone seems to have a mutual interest in understanding the customer experience. One way or another, the customer experience drives many business decisions, and as such, writing about topics related to the customer experience, even if it's through the lens of documentation, might be sufficient enough to strike a cord of relevance.

For example, each of the following topics would resonate with both documentation groups and business groups:

* What's the customer experience with our products?
* What's the customer experience on other products?
* What are our customers' pain points?
* What customer behavior can we infer from web analytics?
* What's the customer experience on our website?
* What customer insights do we get from the large, quarterly surveys?
* Where can people go to find information about their customers?
* How is the doc affecting the customer experience?
* What are people saying/writing about our products?
* Who are our customers?

We all know that learning a lot more about the audience is key to any writing endeavor, whether you're writing documentation or blog entries. I noted in this in my essay [Principle 6: Reconstruct the absent user](https://idratherbewriting.com/simplifying-complexity/reconstructing-the-absent-user.html). My hunch is that learning more about your customers is also key to many other endeavors as well, such as field engineering, product management, business development, and more. If so, can I build on this common interest as a focus to create content that influences my target business-leader audience?

There are many other questions to answer here, mostly strategic in nature. But the fundamental formula for influence is the same -- written content, focusing on the right topic, shared with the right people who have interest in that topic, will lead to influence and visibility among that audience. Any thoughts on this approach?
