One of the paradoxes of my career is to be recognized as a thought leader and influencer on the web among tech comm circles but to feel relatively insignificant and invisible at my place of work. To be a blogebrity online among the tech comm crowd, but to just be a nameless commoner at work.

Surely the same principles of influence and visibility on the web must apply within corporate walls as well, right? If so, couldn't I use the same principles for influence online to wield more influence at work? The formula for influence on the web is fairly simple: write content (about a specific topic) and share it with people (interested in that topic).

But there's one key difference between the web and the corporation: the audience. On the web, I write a blog geared towards others tech comm professionals. I have no visibility or influence outside of this domain. But at work, the people I want to influence aren't other technical writers but rather business leaders &mdash; product managers, field engineers, business developers, support groups, UX, product development, program managers, and more. I have the same influence on business leaders on the web as at work &mdash; that is, not much.

Writing about documentation-related topics won't influence business leaders, as their interests focus on other matters with other priorities. But there is one common topic that overlaps across discipline lines, whether your focus is documentation or product revenues: the customer experience. No matter what your department, almost everyone seems to have an interest in understanding the customer experience.

For example, each of the following questions would resonate with both documentation groups and business groups:

-- what's the customer experience with our products?
-- what's the customer experience on other products?
-- what are our customers' pain points?
-- what customer behavior can we infer from web analytics?
-- what's the customer experience on our website?
-- what customer insights do we get from the large, quarterly surveys?
-- where can people go to find information about their customers?
-- how is the doc affecting the customer experience?
-- what are people saying/writing about our products?
-- who are our customers?
