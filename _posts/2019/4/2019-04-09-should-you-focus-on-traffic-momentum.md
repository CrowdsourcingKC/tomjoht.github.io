I was browsing my site metrics last night, adjusting the date range from the beginning of the year to the present date, and I realized that the most visited posts consist almost entirely of API doc pages. I wrote about this trend earlier this year when I suddenly noticed that 59% of my overall site traffic was going to my API doc site. So once again I was confronted with this confusing scenario where my most visited content isn't necessarily my most beloved content.

Although I like API documentation topics, I don't want to devote my entire blog to this focus. And yet, it seems logical that I should turn my energy towards topics that are hot, that are driving traffic, and that are branding me in marketable ways.

The situation reminds me of an earlier time. Back in 2007, I wrote a [trivial post about a grasshopper](https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/07/31/grasshoppers-that-look-like-aliens/), and I had a sweet picture of said grasshopper that I photoshopped on my kids' head. (That kid, by the way, is now on her way to college in the fall.)

At one point, most of the traffic on my site was going to this grasshopper post. If you did an image search for grasshopper, my post appeared in the top few results. By all accounts, a savvy web entrepreneur would have looked to market the opportunity. Grasshopper pesticides? Grasshopper posters? I could have added more posts about grasshoppers and linked them to each other. Maybe I could have made a killing in all web searches for grasshoppers. And if successful, maybe I could open an online store selling grasshoppers, or start collecting grasshoppers into the world's most impressive collection. Do universities offer PhDs in grasshopperology? Sign me up!

In other words, it seems a bit foolish to tailor my interests and passions around web traffic. So what if [Swagger tutorial](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/pubapis_swagger.html) is driving most of the traffic to my site. I'm not going to pivot my entire career and all my free energy around specializing in Swagger tutorials and going around the country giving workshops on Swagger, selling my heart and soul to marketing opportunities based on this one cause &mdash; even though my initial inclination from seeing the traffic is to try to capitalize on it.

And why not? I was reading an David Brooks' column on [The Moral Peril of Meritocracy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/opinion/sunday/moral-revolution-david-brooks.html).

> Many of the people I admire lead lives that have a two-mountain shape. They got out of school, began their career, started a family and identified the mountain they thought they were meant to climb — I’m going to be an entrepreneur, a doctor, a cop. They did the things society encourages us to do, like make a mark, become successful, buy a home, raise a family, pursue happiness.
> People on the first mountain spend a lot of time on reputation management. They ask: What do people think of me? Where do I rank? They’re trying to win the victories the ego enjoys.
> ...
> But in the lives of the people I’m talking about — the ones I really admire — something happened that interrupted the linear existence they had imagined for themselves. Something happened that exposed the problem with living according to individualistic, meritocratic values.

And after this turning point, they start heading down the other side of the mountain.
