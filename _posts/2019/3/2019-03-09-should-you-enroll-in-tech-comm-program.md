Recently I was chatting with a student from a [Technical and Professional Writing](http://www.sfsu.edu/~bulletin/previous_bulletins/1314/programs/technic.htm) undergraduate program at [San Francisco State University](http://www.sfsu.edu/). She wanted to know more about [API documentation](/learnapidoc/) (since this wasn't necessarily emphasized in her program) and was doing some research about its importance in the field. So she scheduled some time to come down to my workplace and interview me about it.

Our chat got me thinking about tech comm programs in general, in part because the topic seems to be constantly cropping up. For eample, on the [technical writing forum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/), I regularly see threads like this:

Also of recent note, Lisa Meloncon, one of the experts on tech comm programs, [published a cool interactive map](http://tek-ritr.com/techcomm-programmatic-central/maps-of-tpc-programs/) showing the locations of tech comm programs across the country.

Also, my oldest daughter is in the middle of deciding where to go to college (but not in tech comm), so I guess I have academic programs on my mind.

In short, discussions about tech comm programs are lively as ever. But the question is usually whether these programs are worth attending, especially since most current tech comm professionals didn't graduate from these programs. For years I haven't had much advice when asked this question, but now, especially after attending an academic conference in Louisiana (which I wrote about [here](https://idratherbewriting.com/2019/03/01/corporate-exodus-narratives-tension-between-academia-and-corporation/)), I have some more insights.

Before I get into my recommendations, keep in mind a few things. First, I've never attended a tech comm program nor taught in one. I'm also in the San Francisco Bay area, in the field of software documentation. Also, I haven't worked with many people who have tech comm degrees. People frequently tell me I'm in a bubble, so maybe my recommendations only apply within my bubble. Yada yada yada.

Also, my advice here applies *only if you're looking to eventually get a corporate/professional job working as a technical writer of some kind*. If you don't have professional ambitions for the corporate world (for example, maybe you want to teach rhetoric at a university), then you can probably skip this post.

Okay, with that disclaimer out of the way, my advice for those contemplating tech comm programs is to be aware of two main risks with tech comm programs:

* [Risk #1: Not enough emphasis on tech skills](#risk1)
* [Risk #2: Drift from corporate relevance](#risk2)

## Risk #1: Not enough emphasis on tech skills {#risk1}

Academic programs will teach you how to think &mdash; how to analyze, evaluate, synthesize, argue, conduct research, and more. The point of an academic education is usually to deepen your mental faculties and make you more analytical, insightful, and aware. Academic programs tend to emphasize the theoretical aspects of tech comm, looking at discourses and patterns across various genres. They don't teach you the mechanics of style and grammar with writing. In fact, they barely teach you editing skills.

The problem is that when you finish your program and start looking for jobs, most hiring managers at companies won't know much about the theoretical foundations of technical communication. They'll ask for a writing sample, and if it reads well and resembles common documentation patterns (with subheadings and numbered lists), it will probably pass their "sniff test." I say "sniff" because it's almost impossible to evaluate writing with any depth unless you can spend a lot more time with the document than most hiring managers are willing to do (understanding its context, its place within your doc portal, its audience, evaluating the accuracy, assessing the terminology, and so on).

Without more understanding about how to evaluate your writing, they'll begin to evaluate your technical skills. Technical skills are much easier to assess than writing. Hiring managers can assign a junior programmer to probe your technical knowledge. The programmer might draw a function on the board and ask you what it does. With tech knowledge, it's easy to check boxes &mdash; does the person know the various parts of a function/class/algorithm? Either they know what the various components of the function are, or they don't.

Because tech skills are easy to assess but writing skills are hard to assess, the hiring process will often focus more on the tech skills rather than the writing skills. All that knowledge about the theoretical foundations of tech comm that you learned in a tech comm program will be overlooked &mdash; not because it isn't valuable or useful or highly relevant, but because most hiring teams simply lack the awareness about how to assess writing beyond a superficial level.

If you really want to evaluate whether the technical writing samples in a portfolio are any good, you'd need to ask some of the same questions that I pose in my section on [How to interrogate a text](https://idratherbewriting.com/simplifying-complexity/interrogate-a-text.html), which pulls highlights from the various essays in my [Simplifying Complexity series](/simplifying-complexity). For example:

* Does the writer break up the complex information into a way that is easy for users to follow?
* How does the writer create workflow maps or other navigation to help users through each chunk in the larger process?
* What kind of metadata does the information have that makes it discoverable? How is this metadata integrated with search functions?
* How does this information fit into the larger information landscape on the doc portal?
* Does the information follow a progressive disclosure flow, with increasing levels of detail from title to summary to mini-toc section headings to topic sentences within sections and so on?
* Does the information follow the expected discourse patterns within the genre? For software doc, that might include goals, prerequisite states, action and reaction, unwanted states (troubleshooting)?
* Does the information align with the needs of the user? How did the writer discover what information needs the users have? What mechanisms are in place to ensure feedback for future iterations?
* Are the right technical terms being used? How do these terms compare with other terms in the domain, with competitors, and other external sources?
* Does the software documentation communicate the larger story of the product? What is the company's story about the product versus the user's story, and how does the information align the two?

These aren't questions you can easily answer by glancing at a 2-3 page writing sample during the hiring process. If you have an experienced technical writer interviewing you, maybe he or she can ask these questions about your samples to see surface the information, checking to see if these topics are even on your radar. Then you can articulate all the decisions you made around organization, focus, terminology, and more.

But many companies hiring technical writers don't really understand much about tech comm. They don't know enough to ask the questions I listed above. They know they need good docs, so they look for a technical writer. But beyond a few superficial ideas about what constitute good docs (clear language, some visuals?), they simply lack the background to vet the candidate's writing, so they will focus on your tech knowledge instead.

Since most academic programs focus on theory rather than tech, the programs won't necessarily open doors for you at companies (assuming the hiring process gravitates toward assessing your tech knowledge rather than theoretical knowledge). As a result, if you are in a TC academic program, where possible, look to complement your study of tech comm theory with a smattering of technical courses as well. Minor in a technical specialization, for example.

## Risk #2: Drift from corporate relevance {#risk2}

The other risk of technical communication programs relates to a theme I wrote about in my [corporate exodus narratives post](https://idratherbewriting.com/2019/03/01/corporate-exodus-narratives-tension-between-academia-and-corporation/). It's the problem of drift in academia away from corporate concerns. You might find yourself in a tech comm program where people are pursuing masters and dissertations on topics that are largely irrelevant to corporate needs and interests.

For example, take a look at these [dissertation topics from Texas Tech University's Technical Communication & Rhetoric program](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/english/tcr/PHDTCR/Dissertations.php). Suppose you're hiring a technical writer to document your software. Which of these topics looks relevant to the job?

* Tracing economic sustainability in the global coffee trade: The rhetoric of the international coffee organization
* Negotiating the supermarket: A critical approach to nutrition literacy among low-income consumers
* Safety within oil rig culture: Deciphering intercultural miscommunication among offshore petroleum  workers
* A case study investigation of the shared identity of the Papua New Guineans against domestic violence Facebook group
* 'Tell me what it's like': Narrative lifeworlds of white, American expatriate women in Qatar

But you might object and say that these students aren't aiming for technical writing jobs in the corporation, so their areas of study are entirely justified and valid. In that sense, I'm being totally unfair here, but I'm operating on the assumption that students in tech comm programs have aspirations for professional technical writing jobs in companies.

There are many topics that do look relevant to corporate needs. For example:

* Workplace communication practices and perceptions of novice engineers
* Identifying editing strategies for grant proposals: Results of coding editors' approaches to comments, comment types, and edit types
* How games work: A case study of role-playing games as instructional documentation
Reports, recommendations, and retellings: Communicating aircraft accidents and the rhetorics of safety
* A praxis approach to understanding the Internet and computer technologies use among the aging population in India: A study in cultural technical communication
* User experience of access points: Eye-tracking, metadata, and usability testing

See how much freedom there is under the umbrella of rhetoric? Recognize that academics don't see themselves as a tool of the capitalist state, and so you will find that rhetoric is a discipline that stands on its own, with a rich history of analysis that doesn't have anything to do with technical writing at a company. To some extent, the topic doesn't really matter; what matters if how your approach it, because the real focus is to deepen your analytical and research skills.

Even so, recognize that if you do your master's thesis or dissertation on the rhetoric of a topic of little interest to corporations, and then you start shopping yourself around to companies, they might be completely baffled by your research. Not only do corporations already lack understanding of writing beyond grammar, they understand rhetoric even less. They will look at some of these topics and perhaps dismiss their relevance entirely.

If you're going to choose topics for research, focus on research like these articles:

* "Application Programming Interface Documentation: What Do Software Developers Want?" by Michael Meng, Stephanie Steinhardt, and Andreas Schubert. *Journal of Technical Writing and Communication.* 2018, Vol. 48(3) 295–330. ([ResearchGate link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318733467_Application_Programming_Interface_Documentation_What_Do_Software_Developers_Want))
* "When Not to Comment: Questions and Tradeoffs with API Documentation for C++ Projects." By Andrew Head, Caitlin Sadowski, Emerson Murphy-Hill, and Andrea Knight. *2018 ACM/IEEE 40th International Conference on Software Engineering.* ([ResearchGate link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325732077_When_not_to_comment_questions_and_tradeoffs_with_API_documentation_for_C_projects). I also found it online [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~andrewhead/pdf/comment.pdf).)

(I summarized these articles [here](https://idratherbewriting.com/2019/03/07/how-to-design-api-documentation-for-opportunistic-behavior/) and [here](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/12/20/when-not-to-comment-on-code).)

This assumes you're focus is on software documentation. If you're studying medical writing, policies and procedures, corporate communications, science writing, or something else, then do research relevant to the types of jobs you might pursue post-graduation.

## Conclusion

Coming back to the original question: are tech comm programs worth it? My stance is that education is almost always a good move. If you have an opportunity in your life to accrue education, by all means do it, especially if you want a stronger foundation in tech comm strategies and theory. *But if you have your target set on a corporate job, take care to do the following in your program:*

* Supplement your tech comm theory with technical courses. Take as many technical courses as you can, actually. (An ultimate move would be to double-major in both tech comm and computer science.)
* Do research that companies would perceive to be relevant to the job. This applies only if you have ambitions of working in the corporate world after graduation. And what qualifies as relevant obviously depends on the corporate sector, industry, and domain you want to enter.

If tech comm programs don't fit into your life (maybe you already have a full-time job and family obligations, or maybe the programs are too expensive), then don't worry. You can make yourself marketable by doing the same two points:

* Take some technical courses online (e.g., with Lynda.com, Pluralsight, Udacity, Udemy, Coursera, etc.). Take as many as you can related to the specialization you're targeting.
* Make your knowledge visible through a blog. Write a dozen posts that show off your curious, analytical, articulate mind in action. Focus your posts on tech comm theory. This will impress hiring managers about all the writing considerations they probably never considered.

Survey:

You're right on target with your advice in this post.

Employers often lack awareness, understand, or bandwidth to assess writing beyond a superficial reading of style, grammar, and plain language mechanics.

Technical skills are easier to evaluate, so employers often emphasize the technical skills more than writing skills.

Tech comm programs are a good way to prepare for the professional workplace.

Students can learn everything they need to know on their own, outside of tech comm programs.

Academic programs that don't emphasize a concurrent technical track aren't preparing students to succeed in the workplace.

Students shouldn't study technology in academic programs because the tech skills they learn during their program will likely be outdated or changed by the time they graduate.

Academic programs usually don't teach tech skills because most academics lack tech skills themselves and can barely use tools beyond MS Office.

The reason there are only two degree-based tech comm programs in California, despite the fact that California has more tech writing jobs than any other state, is because no one in their right mind would teach when they can earn twice as much working as a professional technical communicator.
