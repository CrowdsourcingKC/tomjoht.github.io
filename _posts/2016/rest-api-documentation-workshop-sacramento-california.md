Workshop on Documenting REST APIs

At its core, REST API documentation focuses on documenting requests and responses. You describe the various endpoints available, their methods, parameters, and other details. And you also document sample responses from the endpoints, usually describing each element and providing sample code.

In this workshop, you'll learn the basics of REST API documentation. We'll dive deeply into the following topics:

* Resource descriptions
* Endpoint definitions and methods
* Parameters
* Sample requests
* Sample responses
* Error codes
* Code samples

You'll also learn about a few tools and technologies that are useful in working with and testing REST APIs. Some of these tools include the following:

* The command line
* Chrome's Developer Console
* Postman REST client
* cURL
* JSON

With REST APIs, there's not usually a GUI interface for users to navigate. Instead, the documentation itself provides the interface that users navigate. Because of this, we'll also explore various ways to publish your API documentation. Here are a few platforms we'll cover:

* Github
* Readme.io
* Jekyll
* Swagger
* RAML

This course will mostly provide an introduction to these concepts. There are many detailed examples and activities you can walk through with the API documentation tutorials on my site here: http://idratherbewriting.com/docapis_course_overview/

All participants in workshop will need the following:

* Text editor (such as Sublime Text)
* Postman REST client
* Chrome
* Git
* cURL

In addition to covering technical strategies for documenting REST APIs, we'll also talk generally about the job market for developer documentation, the skills in demand, and challenges in working in developer environments.
