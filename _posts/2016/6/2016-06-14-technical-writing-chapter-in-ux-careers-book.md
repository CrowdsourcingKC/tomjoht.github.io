Technical Communication
by Tom Johnson
As a technical writer, you help people understand complex technical information. In the United States, many technical writers work in a variety of industries creating documentation for software applications. When people click the help button in an application, your documentation appears for them.
If you work in manufacturing engineering industries, you might create documentation for machinery, medical devices, consumer goods, or other physical products.
In any company that employs engineers, you will probably also find technical writers, because technical writers provide the documentation that accompanies products that engineers build. You might create reference and user guides for software APIs, work on massive projects such as providing maintenance guides for aircraft. or write troubleshooting articles about mobile devices for help center agents. The number of contexts for technical writing is as diverse as the technology landscape.
Regardless of the context, the end result is usually the same: Through the documentation you create, users learn to use applications or products efficiently to accomplish real-world tasks.
What Does a Technical Writer Do?
CREATE DOCUMENTATION
Your principal deliverable is usually documentation for a product, published as an online help site or printable user guide. The documentation primarily focuses on tasks that users perform with the product. You also typically include conceptual information related to your users’ goals with the product. Your guide will most likely have a table of contents, a search feature, cross-references, screenshots, and navigation, among other features.
CONTRIBUTE TEXT FOR THE USER INTERFACE
Beyond creating documentation, you might also shape the text in a software interface, including error messages, tooltips, button names, getting started text, and wizards. Unlike with content in a user guide, you may have to make a persuasive case for some button names and labels. (This is because there are more competing stakeholders with the UI than with the user guide text.) As a master of language, you can play a vital role in shaping the language used in the user interface. In many cases, users never leave the UI, even when they get frustrated and need help, so this is a key area where you can focus your efforts.
MAKE INFORMATION VISUAL
Nothing turns users off more than long walls of text. To help users understand complex information, you supplement your text with screenshots, conceptual illustrations, video tutorials, diagrams, workflows, and multimedia graphics. Even with areas of text, you still make it visual by adding bulleted or numbered lists, subheadings, callouts and notes, paragraph breaks, sidebars, and other visual elements.
CREATE STRATEGIES FOR CONTENT RE-USE
In addition to creating content, you also employ strategies for reusing the content across different deliverables. For example, you may need to provide 5 different variations of mostly the same content for different product versions and audiences. Rather than primitively copying and pasting content from one output to another, you reuse content using special tags, and add product and audience attributes to the content to filter the page when you specify your output. Reusing content reduces inconsistency and minimizes word count for translation.
SET UP AUTHORING AND PUBLISHING TOOLS
In addition to creating content, you also set up the tooling to support authoring and publishing of the help content. Whether you’re using a help authoring tool, wiki, custom website, or other platform, you often need to set this up. You might configure access rights, configure search, construct documentation portals (homepages for lots of different guides), create the stylesheets, and more. Deciding which publishing tool to use based on your requirements is a decision you may also make.
Challenges
UNDERSTAND HOW A PRODUCT WORKS
Before you can write documentation, you have to figure out how your product works. You might wade through poorly written specifications or other engineering documents to gather information. You might explore the product through trial and error, or look over the shoulder of engineers as they explain how something works. Just figuring out how a product works can take weeks of meetings, explorations, and interactions with team members.
GET INFORMATION FROM ENGINEERS
You need to interact heavily with engineers, who may or may not want to take the time to explain things to you. Engineers can also be unreliable in estimating what users need to know, so you’ll have to assess what they indicate about the level of information your users will need. Ideally, you should get to know your users’ level of knowledge, business goals, and other needs either directly or indirectly through support logs, forums, or direct interactions. Regardless of how you get the information, you have to interact with a variety of IT people.
WORK IN ISOLATION
As a technical writer, you work long periods of time in isolation, often in front of a computer. You may be the only technical writer in your organization, immersed in a department of engineers who constantly speak in programming jargon that you may not initially understand. Even if there are other technical writers, you may not get to work with them, as you could be assigned to different projects. Expect to find yourself in situations where you work in isolation for long periods of time.
MEET REGULATION STANDARDS
One challenge in some industries and locations is complying with regulatory standards for your content. In manufacturing engineering jobs in Germany, for example, your documentation might need to comply with specific regulations required by governing standards boards. These standards ensure that the documentation leads to safe operation of the equipment or includes proper documentation of risks. The financial and medical sectors also require compliance with regulatory standards.
Potential Job Titles
Most jobs in technical communication will use the title “technical writer”; however, technical writers often prefer titles that give more emphasis and credit to the many non-writing tasks they do. Some of these titles include the following:
•	Information developer
•	Knowledge engineer
•	Content strategist
•	Technical communicator
•	User assistance professional
Career Pathways/Intersections that May Be Combined with Technical Writing in Job Descriptions
•	Interaction design
•	Web and mobile development
•	Content writing/Information design
•	Content strategy
Ideal Training
A Bachelor’s degree is all that is required. A Master’s degree can be helpful in expanding your capacity to organize and manage complex information, but it is not required.
Some colleges offer specific programs in technical writing, which are certainly valuable, but many technical writers fall into technical writing from a variety of other backgrounds.  
Engineering backgrounds (especially computer science) provide strong foundations for technical writing. If you have solid writing skills in addition to technical depth, it provides a knockout combination in the job market.
If you have a humanities background and want to put your writing skills to work in a technical context, you can also have a lot of success. You can often learn the technical information on your own, depending on what you’re documenting.
If you’re starting out in college, an ideal focus could be to double major in computer science and English. Most of the jobs for technical writing in the U.S. are in software, and the API documentation space is especially hot. (An API, or “application programming interface,” allows different systems to interact with each other, sharing data and performing other functions.)
Other helpful degrees (besides English and engineering) would be a focus on graphics and design, or library science. If you want to go into medical or life sciences writing, get a degree in a related biology or chemistry field.
Regardless of your formal training, you can learn along the way as discussed in Chapter 3 to overcome hurdles in technical knowledge.
Valuable Personal Attributes
•	Courage (to ask questions)
•	Persistence (to learn and understand technical information)
•	Good self-esteem (to handle your role in an organization of highly technical individuals)
