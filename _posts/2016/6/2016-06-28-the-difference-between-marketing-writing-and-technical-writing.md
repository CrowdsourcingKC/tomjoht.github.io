If you love communicating information in a clear, easy-to-understand way, become a technical writer.

If you like to embellish and manipulate words in a way that somewhat confuses users and persuades them to buy something, become a marketing writer.

Okay, it's not that bad. But seriously, I couldn't live with myself if I had to write copy like the big font on Claire's red sign every day.
