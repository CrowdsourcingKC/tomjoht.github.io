Sometimes I think that I've covered every possible topic on this blog that is possible to write about, and my muse becomes silent for a while. But then I remember the purpose of the blog -- to be a web-based log, or journal -- and I realize that the only reason I wouldn't have anything to write about is if I stopped having experiences, stopped reflecting on those experiences, and ultimately entered a zombie state. That zombie state is the death of any career. 

Although most days are the same, they are a little different. My kids have returned to school, and so my summer routine of waking up "when I wake up" and riding my 8.4 miles to work along the scenic, somewhat riparian San Tomas Aquinas trail has change a bit. I now ride my kids to school and then ride on to work. My two youngest (5 and 9) glide along on roller skates while holding onto the back of a bike child carrier that I pull. My older two get themselves to school by bike and foot. 

My wife is an early riser who leaves while it's still dark and heads up to the "Dish" in Palo Alto to walk along a trail that is so popular, if you don't get there before 7am, there is not a single place to park for what seems like miles.

The extra ride to school adds another 4 miles to my route, which puts my daily biking round trip at about 20 miles. When I also add in a few games of some post-work basketball, all the exercise gives me a worn out, empty-on-the-inside fatigue feeling. (Unfortunately, I still manage to eat enough calories to more than enough compensate for all the calories I'm burning.)

The fatigue from riding sometimes carries over into the sense of fatigue I get from the endless documentation tasks. I'm still trying to follow [Tim Ferris' advice](http://idratherbewriting.com/2016/07/20/apply-80-20-rule-to-project-management-tech-comm/) to focus on the highest two priority items first thing in the day and block out everything else. 

Sadly, I'm lucky if I get one of the two items finished. Even if I do finish it, I usually can't publish the documentation I write until I can get the right subject matter expert to review and sign off on the content -- a process that can take anywhere from a few days to more than a week. 

It would be more encouraging if I could see the to-do items decreasing little by little, but I think the reverse trend is happening. For every item I knock off my list, two more get added (both for tasks at work and at home). Sometimes I feel like I'm slowly sinking, and as much as I try to conquer the documentation mountain, it just keeps rising higher and higher in the sky.

I dream about a day when I'll have marked every task as "Resolved," like having reached a state of Inbox Zero. In this state, I could tackle incoming items with such a responsive velocity that those who requested the update would be surprised by how quickly I turned it around, like when you find that someone has responded to your email just seconds after you sent it.

It crossed my mind today that perhaps instead of writing documentation myself, the only way to truly scale and conquer this documentation mountain is to switch from author to curator. A marketer who works near me noted with glee how she already has *four* posts she is publishing on the company blog this week. Did you write them all yourself? I asked, ready to be impressed. No, she said. Teams reached out to her with the content and asked her to publish it. 

I'm not sure I would be entirely satisfied being a content curator instead of an author. Writing is my sweet spot, and where I perform my best (except for maybe setting up authoring tools). But no doubt a hybrid role of author/curator is essential to survive.
 
While the documentation tasks keep building, I'm also trying to build up my technical knowledge of Android and the products I write about. There's a lot to building streaming media apps -- it isn't something one learns in a few weeks. What's more, the developer audience is at such a higher technical level than I'm at, my documentation has to hit on the questions and gaps of knowledge *they* will run into, not just me. I just finished editing a document about 4K Ultra HD media that has so many details about refresh rates, color formats, codecs, and other specifications that I wonder if I'll ever get to the point where I can consume this information as easy as reading a morning newspaper.
 
I try to get into work a bit early to push through some tech tutorials in the morning and at lunch, but taking time out of my mounting doc tasks to step through a tutorial is always a tradeoff. Am I sharpening my axe, which will make it easier to chop down the tree? Or am I learning about something so disconnected to what I'm documenting that by the time the material becomes relevant, I will have already have forgotten it? 

That's the crux of ramping up on developer domains -- unless you're immersed fully in the domain for an extended period of time, the info doesn't entirely stick, and it slowly fades. Then months later you have a documentation task that requires that knowledge, and it's only a dim memory.

One day I'll be an Android master, and I'll know these products inside and out. I'll resolve all of my JIRA items, and I'll find myself wandering up and down cubicle aisles chatting leisurely with colleagues because I literally have everything done and nothing more to do. 

But that day is a long ways into the future, and I only have a vague idea of how it will be. It's mostly a dream. I know that the longer I'm at a company, the more projects I work on, the more documentation I'll become responsible for, and the less time I'll have. As my bandwidth opens up, more projects will take hold of that bandwidth. Someday I may even have a "direct report."

Maybe it's not the tech writer's destiny to ever get a perfect handle on all the open doc tasks and master all the technology details. Maybe this state of slowly sinking but then somehow pulling myself up a bit each day is the permanent state of technical writing. Is this what makes the job interesting -- the challenge, the steep learning, struggling against the insurmountable?

I think I'm going to take a short break, walk around the campus a bit, listening to my audio book, and then return to my role. 

I'm currently listening to [Ready Player One](), by X. In the book, a brilliant video game designer creates a virtual reality layer that becomes a new dimension that most of humanity interacts in, especially given the deterioration of the earth, increasing poverty and other degenerating conditions. In this virtual world, students attend school, interat with each other, and do pretty much everything that you would expect in a normal world -- except that they do it by sitting in one spot wearing Oasis goggles. They have avatars and teleport from one location to another, explore different worlds. and so on.

Well, one day the creator, Andrew Halleday, dies. He is enormously rich and with no heir. Who will he give the money to? He decides to create the ultimate video game and award the prize to the first person who can win the game. This sets off a ton of adventures with our main protagonist, Wade, who learns everything he can about Andrew's world -- the video games he played, movies he watched, and other life trivia.

I'm only part way through the book, but I'm sure that eventually Wade will win this game (or else team up with his cybercrush Ardemis and win it). That's sort of beside the point. 

Here's my point. Both Andrew, the brilliant video game creator, and Wade, the game playing protagonist absorbed in Halleday's game and world lore, love what they do. They're passion and engagement stem from this love of video games. 

Circling back to my mountain of documentation and other tasks, on the one hand, you could view this as a kind of endless list of to-do's, the only really interesting thing being checking off the boxes beside the tasks. I'm not sure I can ever fully change my attitude to embrace the same zeal and drive that Halleday and Wade have with video games, but I am convinced that this element of fun, of obsession and interest is what drives one toward total absorption. And it is this total absorption that leads to complete mastery and ultimately brilliant feats of accomplishment.
