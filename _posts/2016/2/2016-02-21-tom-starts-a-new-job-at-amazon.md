summary: "I'm starting a new job at Amazon Lab 126 in Sunnyvale, California this week. This past week I closed out the remaining projects, tasks, and other final details at 41st Parameter / Experian in preparation for the transition. This week I'll be in Seattle (where Amazon's headquarters are located) all week for training."

Although without a doubt I will miss my colleagues and projects that I worked on at 41st Parameter / Experian, the switch to Amazon Lab 126 presents a lot of new opportunities that I'm really excited about. For example, I'll likely be working on documentation for more mainstream commercial products in the public space, which are engineered in the Lab 126 location.

I don't have a lot of detail, so I'll keep this post short. One small note about the "Lab 126" part of the name. Lab 126 is where a lot of the hardware devices (such as Fire TV, Kindle, or Echo) are developed, hence the "lab" part of the name. The "126" doesn't refer to an address but rather to the numbers 1 and 26, representing all letters in the alphabet. 

I will continue to blog about my experiences in tech comm, so stay tuned and most likely you'll see an evolution of thoughts, processes, and other details in upcoming posts.
