The other week on Twitter I noted the fact that, despite the power visuals play in communicating technical concepts, there's not a lot of good information on visual communication out there, at least in the context of technical documentation. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Itâ€™s kind of puzzling that there is such power in visuals yet almost no good instruction on how to do visuals in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/techcomm?src=hash">#techcomm</a> documentation.</p>&mdash; Tom Johnson (@tomjohnson) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomjohnson/status/707623373963010048">March 9, 2016</a></blockquote>

I've decided to start a series on visual communication similar to the series I wrote about API documentation. With this approach, I wrote a couple of posts a week on the topic and try to arrange the posts into a course-like sequence. The idea is that, rather than producing one-off blog posts, I leverage the power of the blogging medium to create a substantial body of information about a topic.

What exactly is the power of the blogging medium? Besides allowing niche topics to proliferate and the masses like me to publish and distribute information (and become highly visible in the process), the power of blogging is that it chunks up writing projects so that you can push out information in small bits at regular intervals. 

I don't have to start a two-year research project during which time I'll be buried in a library, with my head down in dusty books, taking notes on paper, keeping track of sources and quotes and then organizing it all into a print-based book that is published after lengthy editorial and publishing reviews and production processes. That would be fun, I admit, but that kind of sequestered immersive library research doesn't fit my life style.

Instead, with a blog, you can publish 2 page articles, get immediate feedback from practitioners around the world, and then make updates to your content or course-correct early. You're publishing online, in a space everyone can access and benefit from, and you can incorporate the feedback you get to inform your next posts. That's the real benefit of blogging.
