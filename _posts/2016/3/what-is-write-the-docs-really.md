title: What is Write the Docs, really?
---

Some people have asked me, what really is the Write the Docs group all about? Who are they, and how do they differ from other organizations like the STC?

- inclusiveness mentality, not limited to tech writer role. use of the word "documentarian." origin of phrase stems from devs who don't bother to write the docs. could be a sole person at a startup who plays multiple roles of tech writing, support, and some development.
- developer doc focus, api docs.
- open source foundation. originator eric does sphinx tooling with asciidoc. lots of github use, markdown, static site generators.
- no bureaucracy, no official org. not even a 501C non-profit group. run by community volunteers. no elections, no bylaws.
- not an official staff based somewhere that is paid a salary, no official publications, no membership dues
- a grassroots community of people who come together over a common concern.
- use meetup.com as the website
- conference fees minimal, don't have to sign agreements not to disparage the organization
- they don't create a magazine full of good content (contributed by members without payment), and then put it behind a firewall. there isn't anything behind a firewall.
- meetups, conferences recorded and distributed for free
- not a lot of XML publishing with expensive CMS. not a DITA-loving group. 
- younger crowd who doesn't find it inconvenient to go to downtown on a weeknight
- kind of a less experienced crowd in terms of techcomm expertise, not steeped in academic theory or industry jargon. they like to experiment with a new tool or approach. usually not burdened with massively large doc scenarios of translating thousands of pages to dozens of languages.
