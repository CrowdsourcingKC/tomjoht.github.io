prevaling model for tc is separate outputs. authoring tools both cater to and encourage this.

doesn't work well on web. SEO fails miserably. 

maintenance sucks. file directories grow.

review of each output is impractical.

SMEs only review one.

can't find anything. product cross-over limited.

discussion with Salesforce person long ago about division of docs.

need more sophisticated platforms to make this work.
