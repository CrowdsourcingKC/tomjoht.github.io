Doing something well does not make it important. ... *What* you do is infinitely more important than *how* you do it.


Pareto's Law can be summarized as follows: 80% of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs. Alternative ways to phrase this, depending on the context, include:

80% of the consequences flow from 20% of the causes. 
80% of the results come from 20% of the effort and time.
80% of the company profits come from 20% of the products and customers.
80% of all stock market gains are realized by 20% of the investors and 20% of an individual portfolio.


I stopped contacting 95% of my customers and fired 2%, leaving me with the top 3% or producers to profile and duplicate.  Out of more than 120 wholesale customers, a mere 5 were bringing in 95% of the revenue. I was spending 98% of my time chasing the remainder ... 

... 
Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference. *Being busy is a form of laziness--lazy thinking and indiscriminate action. Being overwhelmed is often as unproductive as doing nothing, and is far more unpleasant. Being selective--doing less--is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest.... It's easy to get caught in a flood of minutiae, and the key to not feeling rushed is remembering that *lack of time is actually lack of priorities.*

...
 
There should never be more than two mission-critical items to complete each day. Never It just isn't necessary if they're actually high-impact. If you are stuck trying to decide between multiple items that all seem crucial, as happens to all of us, look at each in turn and ask yourself, *If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?*

...

Do them separately from start to finish without distraction. Divided attention will result in more frequent interruptions, lapses in concentration, poorer net results, and less gratification.

Use Parkinson's Law to accomplish more in less time. Shorten schedules and deadlines to necessitate focused action instead of deliberation and procrastination. On a weekly and daily macro level, attempt to Monday and/or Friday off, as well as leave work at 4pm. This will focus you to prioritize more effectively and quite possibly develop a social life.


...
Problems, as a rule, solve themselves or disappear if you remove yourself as an information bottleneck and empower others.
...
It's amazing how someone's IQ seems to double as soon as you give them responsibility and indicate that you trust them.

Decide that, given the non-urgent nature of most issues, you will steer people toward the following means of communication, in order of preference: e-mail, phone, and in-person meetings. ...I havne't had an in-person meeting for my business in more than five years and have had fewer than a dozen conference calls, all lasting less than 30 minutes.

Do not e-mail first thing in the morning or last thing at night. The former scrambles your priorities and plans for the day, and the latter just gives you insomnia. E-mail can wait until 10 A.M, after you've completed at least one of your critical to-do items.
