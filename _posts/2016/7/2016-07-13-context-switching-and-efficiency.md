Become more productive and motivated, by Mattias Sander

This article was originally published in ISTC Communicator, Summer 2016.

The idea of Lean is to maximize customer
value while minimizing waste, thus creating
more value for customers with fewer resources.

Motion is the waste of movement around a
product or work-item, for example, reaching
too far to grab a tool

Task switching could be considered to be Motion. Some estimates say that you lose 40% of your time because of task switching.

Kanban -- helps us avoid task switching. backlog, doing, done.

To avoid task
switching, we want as few items as possible in
any Doing category at any given time.


In knowledge work we don’t really have inventory of things, we have work in progress. The more we have, the slower we produce because of the task switching. We can use the Kanban method to reduce our work in progress, and to help us keep track of what we need to produce. In essence, all our work goes through three stages:

“Backlog”. This is where the work-to-be-done sits until you start doing it.
“Doing”. This is where you do the actual work.
“Done”. The work is done.
You might have a few more categories between “Backlog” and “Done” for any given process, but the concept is the same. To avoid task switching, we want as few items as possible in any “Doing” category at any given time.


The trick here is that when you manage programmers, specifically, task switches take a really, really, really long time. That's because programming is the kind of task where you have to keep a lot of things in your head at once. The more things you remember at once, the more productive you are at programming. A programmer coding at full throttle is keeping zillions of things in their head at once: everything from names of variables, data structures, important APIs, the names of utility functions that they wrote and call a lot, even the name of the subdirectory where they store their source code. If you send that programmer to Crete for a three week vacation, they will forget it all. The human brain seems to move it out of short-term RAM and swaps it out onto a backup tape where it takes forever to retrieve.

...

As it turns out, if you give somebody two things to work on, you should be grateful if they "starve" one task and only work on one, because they're going to get more stuff done and finish the average task sooner. In fact, the real lesson from all this is that you should never let people work on more than one thing at once.
