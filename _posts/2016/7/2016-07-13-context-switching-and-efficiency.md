summary: "In \"Become more productive and motivated,\" Mattias Sander provides a well-written overview of lean principles that touch upon the efficiency drag of context-switching. Sander explains the core ideas of Kanban, which is a system based on cards to regulate flow. While these principles were developed in the context of Japanese car manufacturers (namely Toyota), they apply equally to the technical writer's world."

You can read the article by Mattias Sander here: [Become more productive and motivated](http://techwritingengineer.com/keep-it-lean-become-more-productive-and-motivated/
). The article originally appeared in the ISTC Communicator (Summer 2016).


Sander begins general and describes lean:

>The idea of Lean is to maximize customer value while minimizing waste, thus creating more value for customers with fewer resources.
> Motion is the waste of movement around a product or work-item, for example, reaching too far to grab a tool.

These abstracts eventually get more specific, focusing on the familiar problem of multi-tasking and context-switching, which turn out to be huge drags on efficiency.

Sander explains:

>Task switching could be considered to be Motion. Some estimates say that you lose 40% of your time because of task switching.

Here Sander gets starts talking about Kanban. The basic idea of Kanban is to limit the number of tasks you're doing at a given time so that you aren't constantly switching between tasks. You break up your tasks into 3 basic categories:

* Backlog
* Doing
* Done

You only allow a limited number of items (for example, 3) in your "Doing" category. Sander explains:

> The more we have, the slower we produce because of the task switching. We can use the Kanban method to reduce our work in progress, and to help us keep track of what we need to produce.

In a world where we're constantly bombarded with emails, instant messages, social media notifications, and meetings, not to mention the fact that we often have multiple projects we're working on, it's hard to not get swept into the inefficiency of multi-tasking.

Sander's article resonates with an article by Joel Spolsky titled [Human Task Switches Considered Harmful][http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000022.html]. Spolsky talks about the incredible inefficiency that occurs when programmers have to switch tasks:

>The trick here is that when you manage programmers, specifically, task switches take a really, really, really long time. That's because programming is the kind of task where you have to keep a lot of things in your head at once. The more things you remember at once, the more productive you are at programming. A programmer coding at full throttle is keeping zillions of things in their head at once: everything from names of variables, data structures, important APIs, the names of utility functions that they wrote and call a lot, even the name of the subdirectory where they store their source code. If you send that programmer to Crete for a three week vacation, they will forget it all. The human brain seems to move it out of short-term RAM and swaps it out onto a backup tape where it takes forever to retrieve.

Spolsky argues that rebuilding the necessary context to do a complex task like programming is what creates the ineffiency. Consequently, Spolsky says programmers should stick to one focus only:

>As it turns out, if you give somebody two things to work on, you should be grateful if they "starve" one task and only work on one, because they're going to get more stuff done and finish the average task sooner. In fact, the real lesson from all this is that you should never let people work on more than one thing at once.

I currently have two main projects at work, but both could easily occupy my work full-time. In an ideal world, I would simply offload one project onto "someone else." Since that "someone else" does not exist, I have to figure out how to navigate both projects without the drain in effiency. Once I get moving in one direction, I find it really hard to put on the brakes and start moving in a different direction.

Assuming it's not possible to reduce the amount of work, perhaps the strategies of Kanban can make me more efficient in my task-switching approach? It seems no matter how you approach it, context-switching creates ineffiencies. Suppose I dedicate a full week to Project A, and the next week to Project B, and the next week to Project A. This would give me the momentum of a full week of context. But it also drives the other project further into oblivion, making it harder to resume that context.

I could dedicate one day to Project A, the next day to Project B, and the next day to Project A. This might enable me to preserve more context between the two projects, without entering the oblivion stage. But
