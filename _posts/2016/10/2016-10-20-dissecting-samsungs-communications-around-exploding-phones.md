summary: "What would you do to rebuild trust in your brand after a product disaster like Samsung's exploding phones? I looked at Samsung's recall notice and newsroom to see what strategies they employed but found the communication brief, plain, and short of owning up to the full circumstances. I don't think companies can ever embrace communication that is transparent and emotionally honest enough to connect with readers on the Internet."

Dominating most technology podcasts is talk of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7, which overheats to the point that it either melts, catches fire, or explodes. Samsung initially recalled the product and sent replacements to users, but the replacements had the same problem, prompting Samsung to issue a double recall. What does Samsung's communication strategy look like in the midst of their disaster around the exploding Note 7 phones?

Here's the [first recall statement on Sep 2](https://news.samsung.com/global/statement-on-galaxy-note7):

>Samsung is committed to producing the highest quality products and we take every incident report from our valued customers very seriously. In response to recently reported cases of the new Galaxy Note7, we conducted a thorough investigation and found a battery cell issue.
>
>To date (as of September 1) there have been 35 cases that have been reported globally and we are currently conducting a thorough inspection with our suppliers to identify possible affected batteries in the market. However, because our customers’ safety is an absolute priority at Samsung, we have stopped sales of the Galaxy Note7.
>
>For customers who already have Galaxy Note7 devices, we will voluntarily replace their current device with a new one over the coming weeks.
> 
>We acknowledge the inconvenience this may cause in the market but this is to ensure that Samsung continues to deliver the highest quality products to our customers. We are working closely with our partners to ensure the replacement experience is as convenient and efficient as possible.

Here's the [follow-up Oct 11 statement](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-will-ask-all-global-partners-to-stop-sales-and-exchanges-of-galaxy-note7-while-further-investigation-takes-place): 

>We are working with relevant regulatory bodies to investigate the recently reported cases involving the Galaxy Note7. Because consumers’ safety remains our top priority, Samsung will ask all carrier and retail partners globally to stop sales and exchanges of the Galaxy Note7 while the investigation is taking place.
> 
>We remain committed to working diligently with appropriate regulatory authorities to take all necessary steps to resolve the situation. Consumers with either an original Galaxy Note7 or replacement Galaxy Note7 device should power down and stop using the device and take advantage of the remedies available.

Here's the recall notice on their site: 

> Samsung has announced an expanded voluntary recall on all original and replacement Galaxy Note7 devices sold or exchanged in the United States in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and in partnership with carriers and retailers. Since the affected devices can overheat and pose a safety risk, we are asking consumers with a Galaxy Note7 to power it down and contact the carrier or retail outlet where they purchased their device. &mdash; [Samsung Expands Recall to All Galaxy Note7 Devices](http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/)

Several things stand out here:

The term "exploding" doesn't appear, but this is clearly the term that saturates the media. (Just search for [samsung + exploding](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=samsung%20exploding).) I think Samsung wants to avoid associating the term "exploding" with their products, since this term connotes fear and a potential threat to safety in a far greater degree than simply "overheating." 

Lots of things overheat. When your computer's fan breaks, your computer overheats. When your car runs low on radiator fluid, the engine overheats. When you're hot and dehydrated, your body overheats. Overheats is a much tamer word than physically melts down, catches fire, or explodes. 

Although Samsung is trying to own up to the product's defects and responsibly issue a double recall, by limiting the terms to "overheat" and "safety risk," it seems to steer clear of full ownership and transparency about exactly what is happening. In fact, Samsung has even taken action to [suppress a Grand Theft Auto video](http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13333386/samsung-galaxy-note-7-gta-mod-youtube-takedown) that shows someone using the Galaxy Note as a bomb.

Note that I haven't poured through Samsung's communications with any depth, so maybe there are other Samsung news sources I haven't found. Also note that I don't actually own a Samsung device -- I'm simply interested in the communication angle of a product disaster.

Let's return to the above announcement. I also find it odd that Samsung refers to itself in third person. They write, "Samsung has announced ..." In the [first recall statement](http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/2/12767884/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-statement), they use the same tense: "Samsung is committed to producing..."

Maybe this is a convention in corporate communication, but it seems a bit odd to me, as if the writers are a third-party writing about the company Samsung. Would "we" be better? Maybe not, since it's never clear who "we" is.

The big question is whether Samsung can regain consumer confidence in its brand. From a communication perspective, how do you rebuild consumer confidence after a product disaster? Of course from a product perspective, you have to start shipping phones that don't explode and which contain all the premium features at a competitive price. 

But in the meantime, how do you turn around the stigma of producing exploding devices? If you look at [Samsung's newsroom](https://news.samsung.com/global/), none of their recent articles touches on the exploding phones topic. And yet, this topic has occupied tremendous focus on mainstream technology sites. 

Can you regain your brand by ignoring the elephant in the room? If you decide to address the elephant, what position do you take? Do you stroke its hoof, kick it in the gut, or cower in fear below it? How would you speak to the elephant? Would you ever take a more casual/honest approach, and start out writing an article like this:

> H-O-L-Y shit! We are so sorry/embarrassed/mortified to read reports of our new Samsung Note 7 phones catching fire, melting down, or [cringe] in some cases exploding. We have no idea how this happened but are actively dissecting every faulty battery and component in the phones to figure out just what's happening. Rest assured, we will find the cause and fix the issue. Please keep in mind that none of our other phones have any similar problems and continue to be reliable, trusthworthy phones. If you were unfortunate enough to be shunned on a plane due to your association with our Note 7 phones, we apologize in the most profound way we can....

Okay, I doubt you'd ever see that kind of tone from a corporate newsroom addressing what is clearly a severe issue (so severe that analysts project a 2-3 billion dollar loss). With tone, it's usually better to play it safe and be straightforward, plain, and clear instead of letting the words drip with your emotions. 

But how do you rebuild trust except through transparency and emotional honesty (look at the current political scene for proof here)? And yet, Samsung has yet to write about the issue in an emotionally transparent and open way. 

Imagine if the product your documenting today follows an equally tragic fate tomorrow, and now you have the responsibility to somehow address why Gizmo X is catching fire, melting down, and exploding. 

First, it's unlikely the company would let a technical writer address such a highly sensitive topic. This is the land of senior communications officers in the corporate communications division. But suppose you're just such a person. Even then, the CEO most likely would quash any attempt at an emotionally transparent, heartfelt article addressing the real issues in an open, honest, and forthright way that makes them somewhat vulnerable. 

This is also why no one really reads corporate newsroom sites -- because the content lacks the qualities that make it interesting. In company newsrooms and corporate blogs, we're in the land of Marketing brochures and press releases, not raw opinion and honest critical analyses.

In a way, it's good that corporations never really developed a knack for writing in the voice of the internet. This gap leaves an opportunity for bloggers and other third-party analysts to speak in ways that matter. We fill the void with the honest voice readers demand.

Also note I'm just as guilty as anyone else for this dual-face. By day I write documentation for my company. Fortunately, it's all technical documentation with little controversy. I do lean towards more plainness and honesty when cases call for it -- but I never editorialize or adopt an emotionally rich tone like I experimented with earlier. 

Why not? For starters, it's extremely difficult to infuse your text with a lively personality that connects with readers. Additionally, in tech docs, injecting this tone would likely be jarring unless the whole company brand used that voice. My company's voice is friendly, clear, easy-to-understand -- not snarky, chatty, irreverent, or lighthearted. Even if I feel that way about a feature I'm documenting, adopting this voice would run counter to the larger corporate brand. When I put on my blogger hat, however, I also put back on my writing persona and voice. 

I must admit that I *hate* the term "brand," especially "corporate brand." Brand suggests an adopted personality that one fits over something real that hides deeper below the surface. What is my brand? I don't have a "brand." I'm *me*.

There will always been a need for real writers on the Internet. Despite the power big companies have to build amazing products and get customers to open their pocketbooks, they can't find any success in the writing game. In some ways this partly levels the playing field. It also presents a tremendous opportunity for writers to play pivotal roles online.

Will we see the Samsung CEO launch a series of communications addressing the issue in a way that recaptures Samsung's brand? Most likely not. Most companies try to ignore bad press in the hope that reducing the communication will muffle the controversy. When I worked at the LDS Church, the PR department had this ridiculous policy of ignoring damning controversy because engaging with it often created more stir. Only in cases where the controversies surpassed a threshold where *not saying anything* created more stir than saying something did they engage. Geez. 

Again, what an awesome time to be a writer! Yes big companies still saturate the media, but little third-party analyst writers also have a voice that can connect with greater reach.
