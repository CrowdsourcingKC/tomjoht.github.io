summary: "I've listened to audio books from Audible for the past 5 years or more, but lately I've started drifting back towards listening to technology podcasts instead. When I read for fun, I often read news sites. But I've grown tired of reading about politics, which is about the only topic that seems to appear in print given the upcoming election."

## Background

I first started listening to podcasts years ago (around 2007?), when podcasting was a new media form and niche podcasts were all the rage. Then at some point, I got introduced to Audible and started consuming audio books on a regular basis. At least from around 2010 through 2015, I mainly listened to audio books. For example, I listened to nearly every single Jack Reacher book by Lee Childs.

When I want to unwind, I'll sometimes read the news (for example, from the New York Times or Huffington Post). Lately, though, I have been shifting back towards podcasts, particularly technology podcasts. 

I really enjoy This Week in Tech with Leo Laporte. I also find the current tech news pretty fascinating. What will happen with Twitter? Will Samsung recover trust in its brand? Will the new Google Pixel live up to its premium expectations? Who will buy Yahoo, and how did 500 million accounts get so easily hacked? Is Elon Musk serious about unraveling the matrix? And so on. 

Working for a big tech company also helps make these topics a little more appealing. Google has a competitor to the Echo. Amazon's streaming music service competes with Spotify. The new Kindle Fire tablet is taking the low-end market, which is an interesting strategy given Apple's dominance at the high-end of the market.

I had a fleeting thought today. What if I could create a podcast that discussed the tech comm angle to all of the topics discussed on TWIT and other podcasts? For example, what did Samsung's communication look like announcing to customers that the Galaxy Note 7s explode? How did Yahoo let customers know about the account breach? What does the failure of Twitter say about social media integration with documentation?

I'm not actually sure all of these big tech stories
