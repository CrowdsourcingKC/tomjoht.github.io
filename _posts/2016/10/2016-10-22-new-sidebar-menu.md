Now that I work in a space where my documentation is on the web and public, I can point out some of what I'm doing. I mentioned in a previous post about [tools]() that I was swimming in Jekyll code for the past few days. I finished the sidebar menu I was working on. If you look at this [documentation page](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/getting-started-developing-apps-and-games-for-amazon-fire-tv), there's now a three-level expandable/collapsible menu on the right.

The default platform is a web-based CMS (called Hippo). Theoretically, we could have hacked Hippo to integrate the sidebar into the main navigation and then we surely would have added it on the left.
