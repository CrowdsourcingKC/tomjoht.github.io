In composition, you usually teach the rhetorical triangle, which looks something like this:

In tech comm, I wouldn't try to construct the same triangle, but there is a perhaps related triangle that is worthwhile:



When you combine technical knowledge, product knowledge, and user knowledge, you become a key player in your organization. Usually engineers dominate the technical, product managers dominate the product, and support dominates the users. Technical writers need to a decent understanding of all three of these domains to write good documentation.

I know that just writing docs, you pick up this knowledge. But you can also purposely turn up the dial by putting in "extra" time in all three of these areas.
