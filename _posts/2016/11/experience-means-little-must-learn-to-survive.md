I ran across a couple of must-read articles in Tech Crunch this week. The first is titled [Your experience is probably worth a lot less than you think](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/22/your-experience-is-probably-worth-a-lot-less-than-you-think/amp/) by Jon Evans.

Evans argues that technology is changing so rapidly, the knowledge and experiences and approaches you used a decade ago are now pretty much obsolete. As a result, when you emphasize your experience as a selling point for your skills, it doesn't mean much. Evans writes:

> Do you work in software? Do you have more than a decade of experience? You do? I’m sorry to hear that. That means there’s a strong possibility that much of what you know is already obsolete. Worse yet, there’s a good chance that you’re set in anachronistic ways, hidebound with habits which are now considered harmful. If you think your experience is automatically valuable, I warn you: think again.

A decade ago, I was single sourcing content using Robohelp, outputting the content to Word and running a kludge of macros to fix the formatting so we could also print a PDF. Technology changes so rapidly, the profession is unique among other professions that had a long learning ramp followed by a career of implementation. Evans continues:

> The de facto assumption for most of the twentieth century was that experience was assumed high-value unless proven otherwise. In technology, in software, this is no longer the case. Increasingly, instead, your experience beyond a certain point — say, 5-10 years, depending on many factors — is assumed low-value unless proven otherwise.

What's the solution? Evans says the trick to avoiding extinction is to keep learning:

> The most important skill, one that truly doesn’t get old, is the meta-skill of constantly learning new things … and that meta-skill can rust and wither away, too, if it languishes unused. 

On the heels of Evans' article is one titled [In a knowledge economy corporate learning is necessary to survive](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/30/in-a-knowledge-economy-corporate-learning-is-necessary-to-survive/) by Karl Mehta.

Mehta makes a similar argument as Evans but applies it to the corporation. Corporations must help their employees keep up with the rapid pace of technology to avoid stagnating with old, outdated processes and products. Mehta writes:

> The education that the workforce received was designed in the previous industrial age: front-loaded for first 20 years, and expected to apply to their jobs for the next 40 to 50 years. Today, we are in the knowledge economy, and there is new knowledge we are required to learn and apply daily.

In fact, Mehta cites a study that predicts most Fortune 500 companies will be extinct in a decade:

> A [study](http://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/04/15-years-to-extinction-sp-500-companies.html) by Washington University predicts that 40% of Fortune 500 companies on the S&P 500 today will not exist ten years from now.

The solution Mehta proposes is a similar one as Evans: continuous learning. Mehta says,

>  AT&T recently told its employees to update their skills in five to ten hours weekly of online learning or they “will obsolete themselves with the technology.”

Perhaps recognizing the need to help employees stay current with the firehose pace of technological change, my company (Amazon) recently provided access and enrollment to Udacy's Nanodegree programs, among others (such as Big Ranch Nerd). I'm starting an [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801?v=ad1) program, which is co-created by Google. 

A "nanodegree" is a degree that has a granular focus on a specific skill, and takes about 9-12 months to complete. The course instructors recommend that you devote a specific block each day to working on the degree. So far I'm finding that it's quite difficult to free up an hour at work or at home for this, though I must. Everything seems to scream higher priority. I'll need to find a regular rhythm to learning, though. I have in the past with other efforts.

Why Android? Hopefully this operating system is here to stay. Google's Pixel is the latest premium Android device to come to market. Amazon's operating system, called Fire OS, uses Android as its base. There are some differences, mainly with the incompatibility of Google Services with Amazon Services in the Appstore, but the core Android code is the same. I like knowing that the time I spend learning will be in a domain that has widespread applicability and isn't just a niche oddball technology product that is so specialized and unique, the knowledge gleaned would have little use elsewhere.

Before starting this course, I made it 50% of the way through [Android Development for Beginners](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud837). Honestly it's one of the best courses I've ever seen. The pacing was just right, and the instructors fun to listen to and learn from. Udacity knows how to put together courses. When you're matched up with the right course, you don't feel stupid or lost. In fact, sometimes you want them to speed it up a bit, but that's much better than feeling like you're tearing through new material at speeds so fast you can't grok anything.
