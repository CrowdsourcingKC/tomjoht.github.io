summary: "My slides for Jekyll Conf 2016 are available below. I'll be speaking at 4pm PST (Saturday, May 7, 2016) for about 30 minutes. In this presentation, I'll talk about the various challenges I've had in using Jekyll for technical documentation. I'll explain my attempts to overcome requirements with everything from conditional filtering to generating PDFs, publishing across different environments, re-using content across projects, templatizing notes and alerts, and more."
