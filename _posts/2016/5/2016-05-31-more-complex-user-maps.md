In a previous post, I wrote about [linear workflow maps for users](http://idratherbewriting.com/2016/05/30/building-a-workflow-user-map-with-css-and-js/). But not all tech doc (and actually very little tech doc) consists of straightforward linear steps like this. 

Instead, workflows in user documentation are often non-linear, optional, branching, and depending on user goals. There isn't always one way through the documentation, but rather a lot of different routes users can take depending on what they want to learn about or do. 

Today I toured the Stanford Museum with my family and friends. Here's the map you receive upon entering the museum:

<figure><a href="http://idratherbewriting.com"><img src="{{ "/images/stanfordmuseummap.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"/></a><figcaption>This map presents me with a lot of different choices.</figcaption></figure>

First of all, there isn't a directional arrow leading me through the content.
