In a previous post, I wrote about [linear workflow maps for users](http://idratherbewriting.com/2016/05/30/building-a-workflow-user-map-with-css-and-js/). But not all tech doc (and actually very little tech doc) consists of straightforward linear steps like this. 

Instead, workflows in user documentation are often non-linear, optional, branching, and depending on user goals. There isn't always one way through the documentation, but rather a lot of different routes users can take depending on what they want to learn about or do. 

Today I toured the Stanford Museum with my family and friends. Here's the map you receive upon entering the museum:

<figure><a href="http://idratherbewriting.com"><img src="{{ "/images/standfordmap.JPG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"/></a><figcaption>This map presents me with a lot of different choices.</figcaption></figure>

First of all, there isn't a directional arrow leading me through the content. I may not want to see Ancient Americas exhibit. Maybe I just want to see the Contemporary Art. When there isn't a set path through the content, workflow arrows don't make sense. This map is the equivalent of a table of contents in a help file -- it tells me what's contained in each section, but not the order in which I should proceed through the sections.

What if Stanford issues several other types of maps based on different user goals? For example, suppose I want to browse ancient and contemporary *American* art? The curator could draw appropriate workflow arrows through exhibits containing these items. Or suppose I want to compare ancient and modern sculpture art? Or maybe I am only interested in abstract, boundary-pushing art? 

With these goals, it becomes possible to guide users with workflow arrows through the art exhibit.

This map proved to be somewhat useless. I'm sure I could have used it to orient myself, but I didn't know what I wanted to see, so it didn't matter which way I walked in the museum, or which exhibit I explored first or last. I didn't know what to expect, so I welcomed everything. 

The map provides a legend, but I would have appreciated short descriptions of each exhibit, perhaps on the back. 

What I like about the map is that it presents a non-linear workflow to the user. Most help is a mix of both linear and non-linear instructions. There are various groups of doc that might be helpful to know about. For example, when learning about a system, you're in an intro area. In this space, it would be good to read an overview, release notes, FAQ, and maybe a diagram workflow chart. 

In other spaces, it might be helpful to look at how to contact support, resources, and troubleshooting.

Another space might have a sequence of tasks to implement.

Since it's not practical to create and distribute 5 different maps for different users, how about creating workflow arrows in different colors or patterns based on these various goals? This could be like the bike tour maps through San Francisco that tourists get when renting a bicycle. Some routes take you through the Wiggle, others take you across the Golden Gate Bridge and around to the ferry, others take you along the Fisherman's warf, and so on.

One map, many routes.

A good map will explain each route, allowing you to align your desires with the route you want to take. 

More user documentation needs maps like this. In a very literal sense, users would highly benefit from well-drawn and placed maps within the documentation.

In contrast to paper maps, digital maps have a much easier time drawing multiple routes through the same map. You can likely create layers on top of a base diagram in Illustrator.
