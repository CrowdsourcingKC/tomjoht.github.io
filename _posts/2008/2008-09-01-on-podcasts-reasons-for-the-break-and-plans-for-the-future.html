<p>If you've listened to <a href="http://www.idratherbewriting.com/category/techwritervoices/">podcasts on my site</a>, you'll notice that for the past 3 months, I haven't posted any new podcasts. It's also been about three months since <a href="http://dmn.podbean.com/">Aaron or Scott from DMN Communications</a> published a podcast. What happened? Is podcasting dead?</p>
<p>No, podcasting is not dead. But I'll explain my break.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>I've been riding the bus/train to work for the past 9 months (I actually got rid of my old car, which I had to jumpstart each morning). I used to listen to podcasts all the time while commuting to work, but now that I can sit down on public transportation, I open my laptop and write instead. I've noticed that when I don't listen to podcasts, I'm less motivated to record my own.</li>
<li>In analyzing my own talents and interests, I think I'm a much better writer/blogger than podcaster. I don't have a radio voice, nor do I have the rhythm and balance of a <a href="http://twit.tv/twit">Leo Laporte</a>, who can drive a seamless conversation among 5 people for an entire hour. I decided to focus my efforts on my strengths.</li>
<li>When I stopped podcasting, I didn't hear complaints from anyone. No one asked, <em>Tom, what happened to the podcasts? Tom, when is the next podcast coming out? </em>However, I do track all downloads using <a href="http://podtrac.com" target="_blank">Podtrac</a>, and on average, each month listeners download 2,000 podcasts. (2,000 downloads may seem small, but given the small population of technical communication professionals, 2,000 is a sizable chunk of users; only about 1,300 people attend the annual STC conferences.)</li>
<li>Podcasting has no financial reward for me. In the past, I've traded advertising for software, but now that I have all the software I need or want, I need to pursue a different advertising model, which I haven't defined yet.</li>
<li>I became a bit bored with the interview format, and I wanted to switch to a more <a href="http://digg.com" target="_blank">Digg </a>or <a href="http://twit.tv/twit" target="_blank">TWIT</a> style of podcasting -- a conversation about the latest news. But I haven't put together a co-host team nor found a regular time for gathering them.</li>
</ul>
<p>As has happened during past breaks, I miss podcasting. Podcasting has a special community feel around it -- engaging with other professionals in my field, listening to voices rather than reading sentences, driving and learning at the same time. I just miss it. It feels good to listen to podcasts, especially to hear the voices of other technical communication professionals in my field.</p>
<p>I just listened to <a href="http://www.itauthor.eu/2008/08/23/itauthor-podcast-13-august-20th-2008-being-the-only-tech-writer/">Alistair Christie's latest podcast</a> ("Being the Only Tech Writer"), which he recorded after a 9 month absence. Apparently he began a non-tech comm role at his company for a while, and just recently switched back into tech comm again. I loved hearing the conversation -- a casual but focused exchange.</p>
<p>I still can hardly believe there aren't more tech comm podcasters. The field is open. I suppose given my position and the popularity of my podcast, I would be a fool to simply give it up, or cease the momentum. I'm positioned right now to be an incredible source of information for podcasts in technical communication.</p>
<p>Last night I was thinking about my online strategy. Blogging is really just a hobby, but I'm realizing that it is going to be a lifelong hobby. I enjoy blogging, as does my wife <a href="http://whataboutmomblog.com">Jane</a>. We often blog together. (Right now it's past midnight and Jane is upstairs writing a post she's been telling me about all day.) When I have free time, I like sitting down to write a post.</p>
<p>And I like podcasting. Especially listening to podcasts while driving. One of these days I'll solidify a financial model around my online presence, creating at least a secondary income stream based on all my online activities. Podcasting is part of that plan. But even without it, podcasting has its reward. I connect with dozens of professional colleagues all around the globe.</p>
<p>Today I just listened to another episode of the <a href="http://wp-community.org/2008/08/04/episode-44/">WordPress Podcast. Episode #44</a>, with Charles Stricklin. It was a completely enjoyable experience, making an hour of driving time pass painlessly by. If all goes well in the next month with a house deal, I should be driving more, and listening to more podcasts.</p>
<p>So this is a long way of saying that I'm going to be publishing more podcasts, and I hope to be more regular in my release of podcasts. If you have suggestions for podcast topics, do let me know.</p>
