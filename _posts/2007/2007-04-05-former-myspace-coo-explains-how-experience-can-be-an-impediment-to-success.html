<p><a href="http://iinnovate.blogspot.com/2007/04/mark-jung-formerly-of-fox-interactive.html" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 5px;" title="Mark Jung podcast" src="/images/jung1.png" alt="Mark Jung podcast" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></a></p>
<p>Mark Jung, former chief operating officer of MySpace, <a href="http://iinnovate.blogspot.com/2007/04/mark-jung-formerly-of-fox-interactive.html" target="_blank">made an intriguing comment in this iinnovate podcast</a> about how experience in an outdated marketplace can impede your success today, where the factors for success may be based on different rules.</p>
<p>The interviewer asks Jung, "If you were an MBA student today, what kind of opportunities would you be looking for?" Jung says:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>It's a great time, frankly, to come out as an MBA student. I think it's a huge opportunity to come out as a graduate student now because specifically traditional skills, traditional organizations, independent of their size and the assets that they've built, are in many ways obsolete. Which means no one really has a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Whether you have 30 years of experience, or you're a fresh MBA grad with two days post graduation, you're on a level playing field. And I actually would argue for the fresh grad, <strong>you're not encumbered by what has made you successful in the past</strong>. <strong>So you're going to take more risks, you're going to do things different.</strong> <strong>You're going to try an experiment in areas where experience for other individuals will be an impediment</strong> â€” <em>no that doesn't work, that can't work, I wouldn't do that. That's never worked</em>. Those kinds of statements are based upon assumptions and conditions of marketplaces that existed twenty years ago in media or distribution that do not exist today. (8 min. mark)</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, what was true 20 years ago in the marketplace may be false today. If you're making decisions based on successes you had in a 20 year old marketplace, those experiences can hinder your success in today's marketplace.</p>
<h3>How is this relevant for technical writers?</h3>
<p>What traditions were successful 10-20 years ago that might be unsuccessful today? I've thought of a few, but since I wasn't in the industry 10-20 years ago, I have to speculate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Users want to consume help material, not write or add to it.</li>
<li>Users prefer books they can peruse, and they read sequentially.</li>
<li>On a project team, it's the tech writer's role to write all of the documentation.</li>
<li>Nobody reads help instructions on a small device like a phone.</li>
<li>Word and RoboHelp are all the tools you need to produce great documentation.</li>
<li>Newsletters are an effective way to keep your users informed.</li>
<li>Users need detailed instructions for even basic tasks (such as printing or navigating a help file).</li>
<li>You need only know a few core industry standard programs to be a technical communicator.</li>
<li>The documentation you produce must cover the application's entire functionality.</li>
<li>You cannot give away software for free and expect your company to make money.</li>
<li>If you make a screen demo, you must use caption blurbs rather than your own voice. If you want to use voice, it should be someone who has a deep, rich, professional-sounding voice.</li>
<li>Technical writers shouldn't interface with users; that's for the marketing and PR departments.</li>
<li>Documentation should always be packaged and shipped with the product.</li>
<li>All software should come with a free, complimentary manual.</li>
<li>The documentation ends when the project ends.</li>
<li>If something is free, it can't be good or reliable.</li>
<li>Letting angry users comment publicly on your product, even including their comments in the documentation, can tarnish your company's reputation and scare away potential customers.</li>
<li>Tech writers must be located near the SMEs to write effective documentation.</li>
<li>Technical writers write, developers develop, Q&amp;A people test, and project managers manage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know if you can add to this list.</p>
