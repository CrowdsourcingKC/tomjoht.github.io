<p>If you've not heard of Robert Scoble, he's one of the blog icons. He keeps up with 622 different RSS feeds, scanning for relevant information to pass on to readers. He is a human aggregator of information, picking out little gems here and there from a river of news. He's so thoroughly saturated online, just <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=robert&amp;sourceid=ie7&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-US&amp;ie=utf8&amp;oe=utf8" target="_blank" title="googling ">searching for Robert on Google </a>returns his blog as the first result.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com.nyud.net:8080/blog/2007/05/16/how-scoble-reads-622-rss-feeds-each-morning/" target="_blank" title="link to post">Watch this video</a> of Scoble describing how he follows 622 feeds.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="437" height="370" id="viddler"><param name="movie" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/6be21c4f/" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.viddler.com/player/6be21c4f/" width="437" height="370" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" name="viddler"></embed></object></p>
<ul>
<li>He reads to find information to post on his blog.</li>
<li>He reads to keep relationships with others so that when he meets them, he's in touch with what's going on in their lives.</li>
<li>He scans down a river of feeds (rather than reading each feed individually).</li>
<li>He looks for feeds that make an impression -- keyword dense headlines; links (indicating the information is dense and of high quality); keywords related to his industry of interest.</li>
<li>He says graphics slow down his eye.</li>
<li>At Microsoft, he was tracking 1400 feeds a day, but it got to be too much. He lowered it to 100, and has been growing it ever since. Now he's at 622.</li>
<li>He says he checks feeds once or twice a day, or when he's bored.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Personal Reactions to the Video</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com.nyud.net:8080/blog/2007/05/16/how-scoble-reads-622-rss-feeds-each-morning/" target="_blank" title="comments on post">comments on the post</a> are worthwhile to read. Although I like reading Robert's blog and think he's an amazing person, I don't think tracking 600+ feeds is how I should spend my time. In some ways, there's just not a lot that is noble about dedicating a lot of time either to blogging or to tracking blogs. I find it hard to really say that, because I love blogging. Blogging has changed me so much. And yet, over-blogging seems like an unbalanced lifestyle. I'm not quite sure how I feel about that.</p>
<p goog_ds_charindex="1">However, Scoble's blogging is part of his job. And drinking from the information firehose is what energizes him. And he is providing a human aggregation service so we don't have to do what he does. But what I walk away with are questions: Am I tracking too many feeds? Should I be diligently following all those feeds in my RSS reader? Should I switch to Google Reader?</p>
<h3>How Many Feeds Is Right?</h3>
<p>I don't know how many feeds are in my FeedDemon reader. Maybe 250. I have several categories: technical writing, wordpress, and podcasts. When I read blogs in my feedreader, I usually read them as a river of news (meaning, sorted by date, not by feed). I also recently pulled out some feeds and put them into a priority feed folder, because I wanted to keep up with them.</p>
<p>But I don't have a schedule for checking feeds daily. I feel bad that some people leave comments on my blog, but I don't read their blogs regularly. It takes a lot of time to blog -- time away from one's family. I know, because I'm now a blogging widow: my wife has been consumed by her blog. Actually, my wife was blogging and instant messenging and laughing loudly for a good several hours tonight. Talk about annoying! :) just kidding. Nice to see a reflection of myself in the mirror once in a while.</p>
<p>Should I whittle down my feedreader to 20 feeds? What would happen if I exited the blogosphere altogether? What if all this news that goes on in the blogosphere isn't that important, if I can just turn off the computer and lead a happy (perhaps happier) existence without being "connected"?</p>
<p>All of these thoughts came out from this video.</p>
