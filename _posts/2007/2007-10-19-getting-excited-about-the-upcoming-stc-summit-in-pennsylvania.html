<p>When I woke up this morning, I reread the latest <a href="http://stc.org">STC</a> email, which said although the deadline for proposals to the next STC Summit is today (Friday, Oct 19), they won't actually download the proposals until Monday morning.</p>
<p>This is an indirect way of giving people the weekend to finish their proposals, and also a hint that they want more proposals. (Perhaps after the low acceptance rate from last year, many people were intimidated from reapplying?)</p>
<p><a href="http://stc.org/cfp/index.aspx" target="_blank"><img src="/images/stcsummit1.gif" alt="STC Summit" /></a></p>
<p><!--more-->I initially wasn't planning to submit a proposal, because last year at Doc Train West I learned that it's tough to both present and try to interview people at the same time.</p>
<p>Still, I've been thinking about the upcoming STC Summit in Pennsylvania (June 1-4), and I'm pretty excited about it. I had a blast at the STC Summit in Minnesota last year, which I attribute partly to the 20+ interviews I did. I talked with everyone I could find, both notable and unknown. It was an exhilarating feeling. I'm excited to return again this year. The audio setup I used worked great, and the proposal I submitted itself is on podcasting (called "The Art of the Podcast").</p>
<p>Having spent a full year and a half as a podcaster, it should be much easier to prepare a presentation on this topic. I also found at Doc Train West that I really like giving presentations (reminds me of my days as a teacher). Also, given some cool recent sponsorship of my podcast lately, I'm planning to step up the pace with more podcasts.</p>
<p>If my proposal is accepted, I'm also planning to hold a little podcaster meetup session, where I can meet the people who listen to the <a href="http://idratherbewriting.com">Tech Writer Voices</a> podcast, and also where I can trade tips and tricks with other podcasters. Or I might just hold an informal technical how-to session to show people how to use Audacity and WordPress.</p>
<p>If you've never attended the STC Summit, I highly recommend it. Most employers will sponsor you to go. It was so enjoyable last year, even if my employer doesn't sponsor me, I'll most likely go anyway.</p>
