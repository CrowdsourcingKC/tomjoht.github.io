TechCommGeekMom recently attended IEEE ProComm in Ireland and [wrote an interesting post](http://techcommgeekmom.com/2015/07/20/oh-the-academian-and-the-practitioner-should-be-friends-engaging-techcomm-professionals/) highlighting the divide that exists between practitioners and academics.

I've been interested in this divide for some time. In some regards, bloggers and academicians have some similarities. Both groups desire to increase their learning. Bloggers write about their experiences, share what they've learned, seek to better their understanding and so forth. Bloggers aren't just writing about what they ate for dinner. 

Similarly, academics center their whole career around learning. They ask deep questions, set up experiments to test hypothesis, read extensively in the literature of the profession, and tackle difficult issues with detailed journal articles and other publications. 

You would think that academics would feed off of information provided by practitioners, and that practitioners would thrive based on the research published by academics. In reality, however, practitioners and academics live on two different planets, with little interaction or contact across worlds.

Why is there such a divide between academics and practitioners?

First, the question of tools divides them. Academic rarely talk about tools (or even DITA, for that matter). Academics instead like to explore more conceptual or abstract topics that will withstand the test of time. Academics think that tools come and go like the changing tide. What's popular today will not be popular tomorrow, so any treatment of tools tends to be so ephemeral that it rarely catches the academic's attention. 

Practitioners, on the other hand, must stay current with tools, because just about every job description filters out candidates based on the tools they know. Practitioners spend all day working in tools, so they have a lot to say about them. For example, I had Jekyll open 90% of the time today, and I spent a good chunk of time refactoring absolute URLs into relative URLs to support a more flexible publishing model.

The second reason for the divide is perhaps the paywalls set up between academic journals and practitioners. If practitioners in the U.S. are going to read any official publications related to their craft, they'll probably need to belong to the STC. This gives them access to the Technical Communication Journal and the Intercom. But if you're not a member of the STC, you have little chance of ever reading what academics publish. 

There are other journals beyond the Technical Communication Journal. For example, the IEEE publication, [Journal of Business and Technical Communication](http://jbt.sagepub.com/), [Journal of Technical Writing and Communication](http://jtw.sagepub.com/), and [Technical Communication Quarterly](http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/htcq20). But accessing these journals requires you to have access to a library subscription that provides this access (often through a university library subscription), or you can choose to pay approximately $30 per article. 
 
 Unsurprisingly, the content that academics write rarely reaches practitioners, because who is going to pay $30 to read one article?
 
## More than cost
 
More than cost, however, there are other reasons why practitioners don't read academic journals. Even for the thousands of STC members who have free access to the Technical Communication Journal, many times it goes unread. Not so much because the content is written in a thick academic-style full of sentences that try to sound sophisticated when their point is really quite simple. It's that the insights themselves are kind of lackluster.
 
TechCommGeekMom explains her reaction to many of the IEEE conference sessions:
 
>So, attending a mostly academic conference like the IEEE ProComm was a bit eye-opening. Many of the talks were summaries of research that had been done on a variety of topics, and peer reviewed, which was all well and good. I found that the sessions that I could connect best to were the ones that were given by practitioners, practitioners who were also academians, or academians who had a foothold as consultants outside of the academy. There were plenty of sessions whose topics were relevant to the corporate world, but they failed to deliver completely on something new or to provide any revelations to me. There were also summary sessions that provided research conclusions which were incorrect or inaccurate from practitioner perspectives, or elicited the feeling of “…and why are you researching this topic again, and what is its relevency?” http://techcommgeekmom.com/2015/07/20/oh-the-academian-and-the-practitioner-should-be-friends-engaging-techcomm-professionals.

>... Now, in saying all this, I don’t mean to step on ANYONE’s toes in this discourse. Far from it! While I’m sure you can tell that I lean on the side of being a practitioner, this doesn’t mean that I don’t understand the academic side at all. I’ve been there. I’ve taught, too. However, there were just too many conversations in which I wanted to say to a few professors that only teach and do research, “REALLY?? Are you serious?”, knowing well that they were serious. I understand that many universities also have a hard rule about the need to do publish and research to keep one’s professorial job, so that can’t be easy to balance all of it.

In other words, many times the focus of research for academics doesn't seem relevant or insight to practitioners.

On the other hand, sometimes academics do publish insightful and seminal works. For example, John Carroll (who was made honorary STC Fellow at the last STC Summit in Columbus) published works on minimalism that are still being discussed today. Marie Flacke pointed this out in her comment on TechCommGeekMom's post:

> Unfortunately, we practitioners are repeating our previous errors. John M. Carroll researched and developed the minimalism principles in the late eighties… and we are beginning to apply them NOW ;-(( &mdash; [Marie Louise Flacke](http://techcommgeekmom.com/2015/07/20/oh-the-academian-and-the-practitioner-should-be-friends-engaging-techcomm-professionals/#comment-6318)

## Solutions to bridging the gap?
I'd like to help turn things around. My first approach will be to actually read the Technical Communication Journal (and other journals if I can find a way to get access to them).

A second approach might be to record podcasts with academics on some of their findings. The previous podcast I published with Bob Watson was an example of how to bridge that divide. 

A third approach would be to encourage more academics to blog about their work. Or more simply, to write guests posts on my blog (if they don't have their own blog) that summarize or present their findings in an accessible, open way.

In turn I think practitioners can help academics by helping funnel information (such as from surveys) back to academics for their research.

Additionally, practitioners can provide more feedback and interest in what academics are writing about. (In some ways, academics write for academics because only academics end up reading the journals, so it's circular.)

Finally, I think practitioners should call out academic research that fails to deliver. If an academic writes a paper that has an uninsightful, inaccurate, or boring topic, practitioners should let the academic know. (In short, promote more cross-communication.)

What do you think? How can we bridge the divide?
