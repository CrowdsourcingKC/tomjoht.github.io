<p>what's the most innovative? siteless help. bringing help directly into the application. giving users help when and hwere they need it. converting help into an API. this is going to be the next major innovation, maybe? people don't want to go to help, they can never find anything, so why not just birng the help to them in the right places?<br />
last year i thought this innovation was going to be facted filtering, but that turned out not to really work so well.</p>
<p>error messages, fields. you call the api anywhere oyu need it. need to investigate cors.</p>
