Alex Bankoff from Udemy, which produces an online learning platform offering myriad courses, recently interviewed me for a podcast on technical writing. They also created an infographic based on the podcast as well. You can check both out [here](https://www.udemy.com/technical-writing-and-editing/#interview):

<a href="https://www.udemy.com/technical-writing-and-editing/#interview"><img src="{{ "/images/udemypodcast.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Udemy podcast and infographic on technical writing" /></a>

The infographic adds a visual appeal and provides a nice summary for the podcast.

The main purpose of the podcast/infographic is to help promote the technical writing courses available on Udemy, which you can see by browsing the page. Currently there's a course available from Ugur Akinci (I haven't yet taken it &mdash; I believe it's geared more towards beginners). Larry Kunz [reviewed it recently here](https://larrykunz.wordpress.com/2015/07/28/review-learn-technical-writing-online-course-from-udemy/).)

At any rate, the podcast/infographic and course on the same page are related by subject. Of course the idea is that the podcast and infographic will drive traffic to the course. But the course will also drive traffic to the podcast/infographic, as well as my blog, so this works out quite well. 

Let me know if you have any feedback about the podcast especially.
