Udemy recently interviewed me for a podcast on technical writing. They also created an infographic based on the podcast as well. You can check it out [here](https://www.udemy.com/technical-writing-and-editing/#interview):

<a href="https://www.udemy.com/technical-writing-and-editing/#interview"><img src="{{ "/images/udemypodcast.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Udemy podcast and infographic on technical writing" /></a>

I thought the infographic was pretty cool &mdash; it definitely adds a visual appeal and provides a nice summary for the podcast.

The main purpose of the podcast/infographic is to help raise awareness and promote the technical writing courses available on Udemy, which you can see by browsing the page. Currently the only course there is one by Ugur Akinci (I haven't yet taken it &mdash; I believe it's geared more towards beginners. Larry Kunz [reviewed it recently here](https://larrykunz.wordpress.com/2015/07/28/review-learn-technical-writing-online-course-from-udemy/).)
