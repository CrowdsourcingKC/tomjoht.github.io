[Girls Make Games](http://girlsmakegames.com/) is a camp devoted to girls (from grade school through high school) making games on computers. This short video shows the purpose behind the Girls Make Games camp:

Instead of taking games away from kids, the camp tries to channel the girls' interest and energy into creating games themselves. They learn programming, game design, game mechanics, and other aspects of creating a real game. 

## Where to Register

Girls Make Games has camps all over the globe this year. You can see a [list of possible camps and register here](http://girlsmakegames.com/registration.html).

## Best Game Becomes a Real Game

My daughter Avery (who is 14) participated in Girls Make Games last year. Her team's game was voted the best game of the camp. Here's a preview of the game (which you can see on the Girls Make Games site as well):

The girls use [Stencyl](http://stencyl.com) and Unity to create the games. Programming is only one element of game design, though. Avery focused a lot on story and character development. 

The camp leaders take the best team's game and involve professional developers and designers to transform the these games into real games that people can download from app stores.

The funding for the project was boosted by [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2020158234/girls-make-games-grand-prize-winner), where "1,617 backers pledged $31,136 to help bring this project to life."

## Game launch day
Avery's game is launching <b>today</b>. You can download it here: 

* iOS App Store
* Google Play

You can view a preview of the game on the [Girls Make Games](http://girlsmakegames.com/) homepage. Her game is called "The Hole Story." Avery did a lot of storyboarding, text, sketches, and other game design elements for this game. She worked on it with her team for the past several months, meeting a couple of times a month for an afternoon.

The basic plot of The Hole Story is that a princess is transported into an unfamiliar world and time. She has to make her way back home by solving riddles and finding things.

This year, Avery and her two younger sisters are attending Girls Make Games again. We're going to graduate Avery from her Chromebook (which actually just broke) to get her a real computer.
