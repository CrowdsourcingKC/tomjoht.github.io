## Content marketing for startup thought leadership

Another trend I see &mdash; particularly related to startups &mdash; is content marketing. 

Silicon Valley is filled with hopeful startups, but most of these companies fail to understand the power of content in attracting and gaining an audience. The companies are focused on coding the  features that will give them a competitive edge in their product. They fail to realize that pre-sale content (content marketing) is critical to gaining traction in the market. 

Content marketing is the idea that you need to build an audience by publishing useful, interesting content that they trust and value. If you don't create awareness of your product, as well as establish thought leadership in your industry, your startup probably won't take off. 

As more companies see the competitive advantage that content marketing offers, they'll stop delegating the occasional lightweight flimsy blog post to their interns and get serious about generating real content. 

More technical writers will see opportunities to play roles in content marketing. Technical writers will leverage their technical acumen to provide information-rich posts that readers like and share because they find the content informative, insightful, and instructive.

Marketing efforts are too often driven by marketing groups that can't connect with technical audiences because they lack the technical depth to create content that rises above lightweight marketing material to dive into meatier explorations. 

Technical/marketing writers will probably work closely with engineers to help give voice and clarity to the more technical content that needs to be generated.

## Fewer custom solutions, less design

When WordPress first became popular, a lot of people would contact me to create a custom theme to match their existing static website. Over the years, the number and quality of WordPress themes has exceeded the look and feel of any static HTML site. People who started publishing with WordPress simply pick a theme they like, and they no longer needed customizations as before. The role of the designer is minimized as people embrace existing templates.

I think the same trend will emerge with help authoring tools. The tools will have decent looking templates that you can choose from, and will require only minimal changes. There will be less need for designers in help authoring tools to customize things.

You see this with SaaS platforms like readme.io, readthedocs.com, and others (Corilla?) that allow some basic customization but which, being an online SaaS platform, aren't going to a designer rip out the guts and introduce a totally new design. With SaaS platforms, I think only a minimal amount of customization will be possible.

In order for tool vendors to stay competitive, I think more and more online documentation tool sites will be made available.

Despite the popularity of WordPress (take a look at [14 Surprising Statistics About WordPress Usage](https://managewp.com/14-surprising-statistics-about-wordpress-usage)), it still hasn't emerged as a competing help authoring tool in the tech comm industry. This is likely because the infrastructure required to support it favors the single site model, rather than the multisite / content re-use model more common in tech comm.
