## Hearing a lot about "unified customer experience"
This past year I've been hearing a lot about addressing the whole customer journey, or developing a ["unified customer experience strategy"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-you-need-unified-customer-experience-strategy-scott-abel). Companies need to have consistent content while the users are prospects, as well as after those users become customers.

In other words, when a user is exploring a company, they may listen to a webinar, watch an overview video, explore a demo site, read a blog article, download a white paper, and so on. This is all "pre-sale content."

After they buy the product, the user may interact with other types of content: a Getting Started tutorial from a user guide, a support article (when things don't work), emails from support agents helping customers, interactive show-me videos, forum posts, and more.

I hear about the whole customer journey not only from the [Content Wrangler](http://thecontentwrangler.com/), but also others who come to speak at conferences like the [Intelligent Content Conference](http://www.intelligentcontentconference.com/). I find it really interesting that the [Content Marketing Institute](http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/) (CMI) bought the Intelligent Content Conference from structured content guru Ann Rockley and has continued the momentum of the conference's attendance. 

However, now the focus of the conference has shifted a bit. The tagline is "Content strategy for marketers," and rather than trying to bring technical writers and marketers together into one collaborative effort (breaking down silos), the focus is more on teaching marketers how to adopt some of the intelligent content strategies employed in tech comm. The conference organizers explain:

> Our goal is the movement away from the copy/paste mentality of most marketers, toward a format-free, modular and single-source approach to content creation and distribution. (See [Intelligent Content Conference](http://www.intelligentcontentconference.com/).)

No, marketers aren't adopting DITA to single source their blog articles, white papers, and webinar descriptions. But marketers are trying to adopt a structured authoring model that allows for re-use of content without copy and paste. 
  
## Whence my interest in content marketing?

I have somewhat resisted the shift toward content marketing. I have pretty much been content to let Marketing create its own content, while I create my own (the whole silos approach). I write tech docs based in raw, unvarnished information that helps people, and marketers write all that fluffy marketing copy that is half fiction and half fancy graphics, and we amicably exchange greetings while passing by in the breakroom.

But having worked for two startups, I'm beginning to change my thoughts about the role of content marketing and other pre-sale content. Why does a startup product succeed or fail? Is the startup's success solely based on the product's awesomeness &mdash; those features that engineers are endlessly going on about in standup meetings while minimizing discussion of documentation to anything beyond 30 seconds?

During the holiday break, I started reading Joe Pulizzi's book [Content Inc](http://www.amazon.com/Content-Inc-Entrepreneurs-Successful-Businesses/dp/125958965X). I figured this might be a good way to educate myself more on the role of content marketing. Joe says that he started publishing content about his product before he actually had the product. He recommends this reverse approach for any business as well. 

He notes that this approach seems a bit backwards, especially given that most startup companies hope to get a decent 1.0 product, some successful proof of concept customers, and a few testimonials and positive results before they start marketing their product aggressively. In other words, they operate in semi-stealth mode while developing their product. 

But Joe says this is the wrong way to go. You don't wait until you've got a product before you start promoting it.

Instead, you build up an audience first by publishing insightful, valuable content that builds a trusting relationship with your audience. Once you have the audience, you can start promoting your products (assuming they're ready for release).

Reading *Content Inc* has made me realize a few things. First, pretty much everything I've been doing on this blog has been content marketing 101 for the past five years.

Granted, there are a few places that I have clearly failed. For example, by now I should have 10 times as many subscribers and be independently wealthy from converting my subscribers into a source of repeatable revenue. That didn't quite happen. But so much of what I do online fits into what content marketers do that I'm 100% confident that I would be a pretty damn good content marketer.

Which is why I'm a little befuddled about the technical writer role I play at work. As a technical writer, almost every company I've worked for has had clear separations between tech docs and marketing. The one marketing overview I helped work on earlier this year was an exercise in frustration, since the marketer wanted me to put everything into third person tense, keep things high level and general, and write it for the sales people as background literature instead of to an actual customer. As I tried to single source content from the documentation into this marketing product overview, I eventually decided that the two outputs were different enough to be un-single-sourceable.

After that experience, I relegated myself to my tech comm kingdom once again and, like a lion roaming his territory, marked my area. 

But as I was writing tech docs for our 1.0 product, I couldn't help but wonder what the secret sauce must be to having a startup product go wild with success. Would the success be attributable to my awesome tech docs? I doubt it. Would the success be attributable to the kick-ass features of the product? Probably a bit. 

But there's another component to startup success that companies are too frequently overlooking: building a presence in the community, establishing thought leadership and insight, becoming insanely visible online. 

For example, one source I frequently turn to is the Programmableweb.com. It's my favorite site to learn about APIs. If I were a venture capitalist, I would back any API that Programmableweb said to throw my money behind. 

Programmableweb has built up the audience; it has won me over through the worthwhile, insightful content that it has published for years&mdash; content that doesn't always end in a pitch for some product (in fact, I'm not even sure Programmableweb sells anything). It is just awesome content with a specific focus that builds up the Programmableweb brand as an expert in the web API industry.

If I want a startup's product to be successful, I think I'll need to jump into the pre-sale content as much as the post-sale content. I'll need to build a bridge and cross a chasm, as well as change an entire company's culture about these two realms being separate. 

The good thing is, I think the content in tech docs is the secret sauce to good content marketing. The way I see it, if you're trying to win over a technical audience, you need to communicate with them on a technical level. You need to understand the technical issues they face and talk with credibility about those issues. 

I'm not saying content marketing should consist of topics from a user manual. But the concepts that you cover in tech docs could certainly be repurposed into larger, more conceptual articles that address strategies around those topics. 

For example, a topic in a user guide on Generating an HMAC Signature for Requests might be repurposed into an article on using HMAC authentication for APIs, in contrast to other authentication protocols (such as OAuth). 

As a technical writer, you have the insight to provide substantial, information rich content that will build relationships with technical audiences. I think that's why the CMI sees so much value in merging the technical and marketing writers. 

Marketing writing without substance is going to come across as empty marketing &mdash; the kind of brochure or product literature that has such as a strong agenda it's almost unreadable. Imagine if the articles I wrote on this blog were from an outsider's point of view, from a marketer who was trying to gain a technical writing audience. I doubt I would have many readers.

In short, technical writers should repurpose their information rich content into pre-sale collateral that can be used to build relationships with potential audiences in the market. This content can help establish thought leadership, visibility, and trust with your audience so that when you start releasing and mentioning your 1.0 product, your audience adopts it.

Making this realization is surely the first step. A lot remains, such as finding the time to repurpose your help doc topics when you're usually barely meeting deadlines for the 5 projects you're already documenting. But I think that converting the mindset from one that sees Marketing and pre-sale content as "not my responsibility" to a mindset of enthusiastic contribution is the starting point to finding real success for your startup's products.
