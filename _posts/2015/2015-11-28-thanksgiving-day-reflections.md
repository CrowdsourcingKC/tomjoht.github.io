I've been planning to convert my API doc course into an online course for a while. I mostly have everything in place now; it's just a matter of doing it. These past few weeks I've been trying to clean up a few things with my blog, and the holidays seem to bring their own slow-down, with parties to attend, get-togethers, family activities, and so on.

I want to outline a few thoughts and plans I have for recording the videos. 

First, I need to make sure the content is more or less locked down before I start recording anything. It would be a waste to record a video, post-process it, and later decide that the content itself needs a lot of revision. I've been fine-tuning the [API documentation course content](http://idratherbewriting.com/docapis_course_overview/) a lot as I was teaching some API doc workshops.
