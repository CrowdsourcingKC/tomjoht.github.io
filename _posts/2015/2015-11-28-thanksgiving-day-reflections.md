I've been planning to convert my API doc course into an online course for a while. I mostly have everything in place now; it's just a matter of doing it. These past few weeks I've been trying to clean up a few things with my blog, and the holidays seem to bring their own slow-down, with parties to attend, get-togethers, family activities, and so on.

I want to outline a few thoughts and plans I have for recording the videos. 

First, I need to make sure the content is more or less locked down before I start recording anything. It would be a waste to record a video, post-process it, and later decide that the content itself needs a lot of revision. I've been fine-tuning the [API documentation course content](http://idratherbewriting.com/docapis_course_overview/) a lot as I was teaching some API doc workshops recently. 

In my API doc course, I decided to contextualize a lot of concepts around a simple weather API on Mashape. The API had a few changes (suddenly requiring credit card to sign up for the free plan), but the developer reverted to the earlier model he had, so I think it's fairly stable. Still, it's a risk to use a specific context of an API for a course. The API could change or be discontinued, and then I'd have to alter my course. On the other hand, not having a specific context makes the learning experience more confusing.

I have a technical setup that should be interesting. I purchased a few studio items:

* Green screen + lighting kit
* Canon Vixia video camera
* Teleprompter adapter for iPad
* Teleprompter remote control

I've spent about $600 on this equipment. The green screen will allow me to superimpose myself in front of a slide presentation of some kind. After watching some how-to videos on Udemy, I've decided this is the way to go. 

In thinking about my larger strategies for this blog and so forth, I want to work on larger projects similar to this REST API course. Standalone blog articles (like this one) are fine, but I get more satisfaction in working on something larger. Blog article have such short lives. They get shorter and shorter as we're inundated with new information all the time.

I want to write lengthier content &mdash; the kind that can be converted into books or courses (or both). The blog posts I write will more likely be short updates about the progress of the projects I'm working on.
