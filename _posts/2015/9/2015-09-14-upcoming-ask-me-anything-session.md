If you've ever seen the AMA ("Ask Me Anything") posts on Reddit, they're special themes in which an interesting or famous person makes him or herself available for questions about anything for about an hour.

Vinish Garg is following this same pattern on Content Hug, and he invited me to do an AMA session on his site. The AMA is scheduled for Thursday, September 17 at 9:00am PST for one hour. 

For details, see the [details on Content Hug](http://contenthug.com/september-17-live-ama-ask-me-anything-i-am-tom-johnson-owner-influential-blog-idratherbewriting). 

I don't always have a ton of answers, but I'll offer candid and transparent responses to any question you throw my way.
