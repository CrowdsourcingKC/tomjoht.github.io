One of the challenging aspects of technical writing is avoiding broken links in your output. Consider this example. You have three outputs, with different topics included for different audiences. The topics each have inline cross references pointing to the other topics, but since some of the topics aren't included for each audience, you risk having a broken link for the output that omits that topic.

Additionally, technical writers frequently manage large numbers of topics, renaming titles, deleting some topics and combining information in other places, and more.
