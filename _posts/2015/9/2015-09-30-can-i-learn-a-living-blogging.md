A reader asks,

>Can I earn a living by writing a blog? How do blog writers make money?

There's no money in blogging. I have some ads that I got by asking companies if they wanted to be a sponsor, but even ads on my blog are decreasing. 

Blogging's real value is in establishing yourself as an expert in a field. This gives you credibility with employers and other professionals. For example, I'm teaching some API workshops that I got mainly through notoriety from my blog. 

So first ask yourself who you want to be. Then write 100 posts on that subject. You'll brand yourself as an expert in that topic, and that will open doors for you.

Technical writing is probably the only lucrative and practical option for English majors. You should consider trying to get short on-site contracts in an urban hub where there are lots of tech companies. 

Short contracts are fairly common, though they can be tough b/c you have to be tech savvy and quick to learn, with little benefit for time or other on boarding.
