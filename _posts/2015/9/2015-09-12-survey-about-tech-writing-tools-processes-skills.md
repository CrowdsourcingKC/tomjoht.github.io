A couple of weeks ago, in a [podcast with Lisa Meloncon](http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/08/10/lisa-meloncon-academic-practitioner-divide-podcast/), we talked about ways to help bridge the gap between academics and practitioners. One way practitioners can help academics is by responding to surveys so that academics can gather the research information they need.

Rebecca Pope is a graduate student at the University of North Texas in Technical Communication. She needs to interview technical editors and writers for a research project in her Digital Literacies course, where she is  analyzing responses to skill requirements in job postings. The interview, which explores your use of digital tools and technology in your career, is 7 questions and takes about 5 minutes to answer.

Here are the questions: 

1. What is your current job title?
2. What are your most used tools? (Ex: Office, Adobe, etc.)
3. What is your definition of digital literacy and how does it relate to your job?
4. What is the most important technical skill you possess?
5. How  valuable is being able to teach yourself new technical skills?
6. What technical skill do you most want to learn or expand on to better help you in your job?
7. What technical skill were you surprised to find is necessary to your job?

Here are my responses: 

1. What is your current job title? Senior technical writer
2. What are your most used tools? (Ex: Office, Adobe, etc.) Intellij/Webstorm, Sublime, Snagit, Illustrator, Jekyll, Mercurial, iTerm, Chrome, and HTML, CSS, Liquid, JS
3. What is your definition of digital literacy and how does it relate to your job? Digital literacy is how tech savvy someone is. I'm constantly evaluating whether my developer audience would understand certain tasks (e.g., installing EPEL packages on Linux) or whether they need detailed instruction. (I wouldn't call it "digital literacy" though. Digital literacy is a term I'd use to describe what my parents (who are in their late seventies) lack. If someone is tech savvy, I'd say the person is an "experienced developer." If not, the person is "not technical.")
4. What is the most important technical skill you possess? My ability to learn on my own.
5. How valuable is being able to teach yourself new technical skills? Probably the most important skill. I have a personal subscription to http://Safaribooksonline.com  and a corporate subscription to http://Lynda.com . I use them regularly to learn a lot of different things.
6. What technical skill do you most want to learn or expand on to better help you in your job? Using Mercurial (it's similar to Git) so that I can better integrate with and review platform API doc.
7. What technical skill were you surprised to find is necessary to your job? JIRA. This is the issue tracking system used by nearly every company. It's a robust tool, so knowing how to filter issues and stay updated is key.
