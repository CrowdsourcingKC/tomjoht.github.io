'm a software program manager-turned technical writer. Your blog is by far the best resource I've found for software technical writing. Thanks for all you do.

I've been creating our API and platform documentation using Apiary.io (this was a request from our Dev manager). While I think it's great for API reference, it's just not built for great developer documentation. I've seen some developer sites that I really like, but I can't figure out what tools they're using to create them. For example, love Shopify's developer documentation and Facebook's documentation that includes video tutorials and lots of graphics are great. I also really like the clean look of documentation like Stripe API and Sendgrid https://sendgrid.com/docs.

I have two questions. First, what are the most commonly used tools for building developer documentation sites like these? Second, when I see a site I like, is there a way to find out what tools they used to build it?

This is what I've done so far in Apiary. http://docs.gbd.apiary.io/#. These are public, so you should be able to access them. 

If you have any insight here, I'd really appreciate hearing it.
