<p>Yesterday I gave a presentation to STC Berkeley about ways to bridge the gap between tech comm tools and web development tools. After talking about innovation patterns, I focused on static site generators, specifically Jekyll. I also explained how DITA compares to Jekyll.</p>
<h2>Slides</h2>
<p>Here are the slides:</p>
<p><a href="http://tomjohnson1492.github.io/jekyllvsdita/#/"><img src="/images/jekyllvsditathumb.png" alt="Jekyll vs DITA presentation" width="350" height="211" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22715" /></a></p>
<h2>Audio recording</h2>
<p>Here's the MP3 audio file:</p>

<p>(Sorry, my attempts to record the screen using Camtasia failed -- Camtasia crashed. I think my MacBook Pro Retina display didn't jive with the old projector I was hooked into.)</p>
<h2>Links to more information</h2>
<p>Note that this presentation is similar to the <a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/03/18/recording-of-innovation-in-technical-communication-keynote-at-tcworld-india-2015/">keynote I gave at tcworld India</a>. Personally, I felt the India presentation went better. If I were giving this presentation again, I would probably drop the DITA comparison, shorten the exploration of innovation, and just show static site generators in depth.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/03/23/new-series-jekyll-versus-dita/">Jekyll Versus DITA</a> series for more detail about the tool comparisons.</p>
