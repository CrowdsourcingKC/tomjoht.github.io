I'm going to be giving a presentation and workshop at the STC Summit in Anaheim, California in May. Here's the presentation: 

Writing tech docs like a hacker with Jekyll

Static site generators are a new breed of documentation tools that are much more common in
engineering groups where developers contribute to the documentation.

Jekyll is one of the most popular static site generators, but it is highly similar to others in the same category such as Docpad, Middleman, Wintersmith, and Octopress. You can see a more comprehensive list of the top static site generators at [Staticgen.com](http://www.staticgen.com). 

Jekyll projects approach doc as code. All the files are open and editable within a code editor, and your files can live in the same repository as your program code or within the same version control workflow.

Although developers and web engineers love Jekyll, there are significant challenges to overcome when adopting Jekyll for any robust tech comm publishing scenario.

The Jekyll documentation theme I developed is here: http://idratherbewriting.com/documentationthemejekyll/.

The source code is here: https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/documentationthemejekyll.

You can learn more about Jekyll itself here: https://jekyllrb.com/

As an open source theme, you can fork my doc theme project, make edits, and publish your own version of the theme with your own modifications and improvements.

This doc theme has the potential to generate momentum and interest with other technical writers since it allows for tech writers to move past HATs and DITA and adopt a platform that is preferred by engineers and web developers.

Academics might also like it because this doc platform doesn't cost anything and yet provides for all the same robust features that a help authoring tool provides.

This session belongs in the API documentation or Tools and Technology track, since Jekyll is often used as a doc tool for API or developer doc shops. 

Although I'm focusing on a specific tool (Jekyll), it's not a vendor presentation (Jekyll is open source) and it would be relevant for any person using a static site generator, no matter which one they are using.
