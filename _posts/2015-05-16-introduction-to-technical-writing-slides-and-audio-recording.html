<p>A few weeks ago I gave a presentation to a small group of beginning technical writers in India. The presentation was a 20 minute introduction to technical writing, and I gave the presentation over Skype.</p>
<h2>Slides</h2>
<p>Here are the slides:</p>

<h2>Audio recording</h2>
<p>Here's the MP3 audio file:</p>

<h2>Links to more information</h2>
<p>This presentation is similar to <a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/2009/03/24/introduction-to-technical-writing-podcast/">another introductory podcast</a> I recorded on technical writing some years ago.</p>
