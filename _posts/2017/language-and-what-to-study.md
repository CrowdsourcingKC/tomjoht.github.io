are we more interested in the critical thinking mindset than with the subject itself?

- ramifications: any subject can be potentially interesting
- person who studies history while working as a tech writer.... you could have just studied something tech writing
- are we fascinated to see the way people think?
- descarte's essay ... brilliant to see a mind in motion, thinking and analyzing
- my experiment at columbia: 10 for 10. go deep. find that we connect into larger issues at some point. like all roads leading to rome.
- the more trivial, the more interesting. the philosophy of oranges. the philosophy of sidewalks. whole books have been written about the pencil. the ability to see something interesting in something that everyone else misses. revisionist history. turn something known upside down on its head, show another side of it.
- how sustainable?
- problem with this inquiry language.... problem with using language as a tool for inquiry is that you can use it as such, but you don't want that to be your final product. you then convert this meandering brainstorming prose into an essay that seems as if you knew these points all along. or does the user want to go along for the ride with all the twists and turns?
- what if you could convert your mind into a thinking thing? become more of a philosophical thinker?
- can language be used as a tool for thinking? this is kind of what separates out good bloggers from bad ones.
- language lets us extend out thoughts, hold more ideas out. they quickly vanish if you can't write them down. also lets you see what you're thinking, so not only do you remember them, you can also think more thoroughly?
- yes, but dont write about writing. that is boring, esp. if you are expounding on a theory. instead, show us evidence. what is something banal about tech writing?

-----------

scale? sharing content across repos? mechanisms? this leads us to tools.


comprise versus consist of

- how can this be interesting?
an example of snobbery
hypercorrection
what are the "rules" of writing? these rules are a collective notion.
the smug feeling of knowing someone is using it wrong
grammar superiority.
people who have very little going on in their lives tend to blow small things out of proportion.

comprise = contain/include

The key rule to remember is that the whole comprises the elements or parts, and the elements or parts compose the whole


Because sloppy language leads to sloppy thinking, and bad usage creeps from blogs and advertising to print to work settings.

a word used incorrectly should be allowed to contain its new definition when used incorrectly enough. This one is pretty funny, though.

relation to compromise? how about promise? com - promise?

compromised
comprise and compose -- both don't seem to mean anything. com = together + pose or prise?

not wure when it's ever a good idea to use comprise instead of contain. the us. comprises 50 states. when does it just sound awesome? there are plenty of clearer words so people only choose this one when they are trying to sound fancy.


1. when is snobbery about language acceptable?
2.

tech writers seem to have dumbed down their vocabulary. i read my wife's papers, and a great many words she uses are words i could never use in a paper. and philosophically, i don't really feel the need to use them. what is the point of using a more sophisticated word when you can substitute it for a simpler one? we have so many words in our language....

but doesn't language couple with thought, so if we adopt simplified tech english, are we simplifying our thoughts as well? is this why tech writers lead such boring lives?

language is a social status, and when we speak more formally, are we trying to crawl up that social scale?
language is how we show our education? it also affects our level of sophistication. if you can use 23 different words for snow, it shows that you have a lot of education on this topic.

is it alarming that tech writers have more or less simplified their vocabulary to the point that they use simplistic writing almost always? not just words, but simpler constructions? reading an academic paper is an experience in recognizing how far we've come.

is there ever a time when you should use comprise instead of contains or includes?

Your vocabulary demonstrates your expertise.

the problem with tech is that we do have sophisticated language,but it's jargon around a domain. i was explaining that the \_docs folder is a colleciton.

the email from a disgruntled person about the lack of defined terms like like REST API. this actually gets back to the heart of tech comm and the challenges. we want to use simple language, but you really can't.

maybe you could go through your entire REST API doc site and implement popovers for all of the vocab. this could be a great exercise in how to break down these language barriers.
