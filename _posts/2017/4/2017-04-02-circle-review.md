With four kids and a house full of devices, it can be pretty hard to wrangle devices from kids' hands and shut off Internet time. In the past, I tried putting all the kids' devices onto a guest network and all my devices onto a main network. When I wanted to shut off the  kids' access to the internet, I would log into my router and shut off the guest network.

It sort of worked, except that each time my wife wanted to turn off kids' access to devices, she never wanted to log into the router. i tried showing her how, but she paid almost no attention and didn't have any interest in going to 192.168.1.1 and navigating through the confusing options in the router's interface. (Router interfaces, by the way, usually have horrible interfaces.)

So when my wife wanted to turn off the devices, she instead went over to the router + modem, which is a jumble of cords in a corner, and she would unplug one or more cords until the Internet stopped working. This would drive me nuts because I'm usually not just playing on computer but doing something constructive. At the same time, my wife loves reading on her phone, and she can read using cellular Internet just fine, without the need for wifi.

This scenario usually ended up with me fishing around in the router cords trying to determine which cord she unplugged, grumbling under my breath, and then plugging stuff back in until the right lights started blinking. My favorite times are when she unplugs the cable modem but not the router, so the wireless router still projects all the networks, and allows you to connect, but no web pages every load.

I'm happy to say, fingers crossed, these days of online/offline Internet connectivity might be over. My wife purchased a device called Circle. This little box sits between your router and your wifi. All wifi-connected devices go through Circle to get to the router's wifi. Circle gives you a nifty little app where you can turn off the Internet for any device hooked into your wifi. You can also associate profiles of your family with different devices. And you can set up rules about when Internet goes off, and even set time limits for certain sites. For example, you can set a one hour time limit for Facebook and Snapchat for a specific profile.

Here are a few screenshots:

Best of all, this app is simple and easy to figure out. The only tough part is identifying all your devices and naming them. You can see the list of devices in the app, but your device's original name is often something like dp10004mxy, and you have to try to guess what's what. I sorted out the Fire TV, Echo, Dot, Kindle tablets, Kindle e-readers, Macbook Pros, iPad, iPhones, and other devices in our house this weekend. We probably have upwards of a dozen or more devices. It's kind of sad to be so buried in all of these devices.

For the longest time, I could not believe that no app exists to easily manage Internet connectivity per device. I'm glad that someone has finally invented this and made it such an easy experience for users.

(BTW, this isn't any kind of paid review or sponsored post. I just really like this device.)
