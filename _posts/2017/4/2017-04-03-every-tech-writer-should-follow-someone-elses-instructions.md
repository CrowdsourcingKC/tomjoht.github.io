This past weekend, as most people end up doing in their free time, I put together some stuff by following someone's instructions. Well, not much. My wife has ordree Tinker crates for our kids. These are little science kits in a box that require you to follow instructions to make some cool little experiemnt. in this case, I helped my 5 year old build an infinity mirror. Really this tinker crate was beyond my 5 year old's ability to follow the instructions, so it was mostly me assemblying the thing and having her stick adhesives on certain things, uncover sticky backings and place little objects where they should go. You proably assembled something this past weekeend as well. My daughter spent the afternoon assembling a new desk from Ikea in her bedroom -- a task I was more than happy to leave entirely up to her to complete, from start to end.

While I was assembling the infinity mirror, I got stuc on a certain step. We all get stuck on some step 9or another in following instructions. The instructions said to put the small silver circles onto the little circuulate adhesives. The only thing is, what small silver circles? I How small is small? The size of a dime? The size of a silver dollar? I wasn't sure. Finally I figured it out, but not before feeling entirely stumped for a good 5 minutes and watching some NBA basketball in the downtime.

I asked my daughyer if she got stuck anywhere in putting together her Ikdea desk. Not really, she said. She said she had some leftover pieces and wasn't sure if she'sd missed something of if they were extras.

As you're notw expecting, I ddi realize a few things in putting together my little project. Without fail, every assembly manual that accompanies some product I have to put together starts out by listing all the parts in the package. It's not so much important to know that you got everything you're supposed to have gotten. No, what's important here is to understand the names of all of these little parts. This list of contents is a map that assigns names to the parts you'll be working with. Imagine if you have to assemble something without having this list of parts with their names. When you go to a step that said, place the doohicky on the thingamajiggle, or rather something like, take the left hexapiece and insert it into the square knobthing, or whatever, you would have to guess what each name referred to. Even with Kidea's wordless manuals, they still name their parts with @x, #x, and so forth names.

So yes, I think we will all admit that assembly instructions must contain this list of parts along with their names, and we assume that the writer will use these names throughout the instructions.

And yet, with software documentation, since we don't ship a package of "stuff" with a bag of "parts" to users, we often think we can get away with not describing a list of terms the roughly corresponds with what users will be working with. For some reason, software instructions feels like it can omit this. But in reality, we have our own list of special terms, and users will likely get stuck on some step where we tell them to do X, to configure the thermacabobulator, and the user will be thinking, WTF?

Maybe if I look at the glossary just like that list of parts in a product that I assemble, won't be so casual in omitting it, or in verring into other terms not on the list.
