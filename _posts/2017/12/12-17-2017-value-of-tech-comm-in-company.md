## Introduction

Questions about the value of the tech writing re-surface with every resourcing decision. When managers want headcount for a job requisition (whether expanding or backfilling), or when senior execs start rebalancing the workforce, this longstanding, sensitive issue of the tech writer's value moves back into the spotlight. Should we open another tech writer position? Should we backfill the position? Why?

The value question becomes especially poignant for technical writers because our very jobs are at stake. It's not simply a matter of which authoring tool to use. Additionally, the meaningfulness of our work is challenged by these questions. If tech writers are deemed to add little value, it suggests our career is unimportant. We are engaged in a lifelong endeavor that does not matter.

Given the lengthy period of time this question has been debated in the tech comm industry (potentially since the beginning!), and the many articles written, what can I add? Regardless of whether I add original insights, I hope to make sense of the value debate for myself, for my own role and company dynamics. Conclusions about value inform the tech writing model within a company; they inform my daily activities and focus, how I prioritize and orchestrate my work, how I interact with other groups, and more.

In this essay, I'll explore these questions:

* What is the value tech writers provide to a company?
* How does this value inform the tech writing model in an organization?
* Why is it so difficult to communicate the value of doc to the business interests of a company?
* How should tech writers position their value to senior leaders?

I'll break this essay into three parts to make it more digestible online.

In a nutshell, my overall argument makes two premises to reach a conclusion.

* Premise 1: Documentation is, in fact, valuable. It derives this value not from a carefully measured financial ROI, which is impractical to measure, but from perceived value by the many groups within the company (not to mention end users) actually using it.
* Premise 2: Technical writers play a critical role in creating documentation that is valuable. The technical writers should be full time and focused across the documentation as a whole, not just contractors focused on a specific project that they complete and then abandon.
* Conclusion: Full-time technical writers have high value to the company.

Note that my first premise is that *documentation* has value, not that technical writers have value. It is a non-sequitur that just because documentation has value, technical writers are necessary. Conceivably, anyone in the organization can write documentation. A business leader can believe that documentation is valuable but not concede that tech writers are necessary to create it.

Therefore I need to also make a case that not only is documentation valuable, but that technical writers are essential for creating this documentation. Not just external contractors or vendors hired to create documentation on a per project basis (which they abandon after the contract ends), but full-time technical writers. A model where a company doesn't have any full-time tech writers, but just contracts out doc work on an as-needed basis, leads to docs that are somewhat narrow and ineffective.

## Past research on tech writer value

Before jumping into the value debate, I want to review some of the research that has been done previously. Bob Watson has a good introduction to the topic in [Measuring the value of technical writing](http://docsbydesign.com/2017/08/06/measuring-the-value-of-technical-writing/). He mainly cites research from Ginny Redish in a seminal 1995 article, "Adding Value as a Professional Technical Communicator" (Technical communication, 42(1)). Reddish defines value in terms of measurable return on investment (ROI):

> Managers are interested in the “bottom line”; in costs and benefits, in return on investment. We add value when we contribute to improving an organization’s return on its investment in what we do. In considering this balance, we can focus either on reducing the investment or on improving the return on the investment.

Redish's approach to attempt to measure the value against the bottom line is the typical line of reasoning that you hear in these discussions. However, as we shall later see, this approach doesn't yield practical results. Redish properly acknowledges the complexity of measuring ROI. She notes how budgets within organizations are often independent, and savings in one group's budget might not matter if your ROI is calculated in another group's budget. Tech docs probably saves a great deal of money in Support, but if Support and Tech Docs are driven by different budgets, grouped in separate divisions, making arguments about ROI might not resonate with these managers. Redish explains, quoting an earlier publication she co-authored:

> The manager who must get the manual to the printer on a certain schedule and within a certain cost is not responsible for whatever havoc the manual might cause later on (Redish and Selzer 1985, p. 51).

Continuing with the Support versus Tech Docs example, Support might be more invested in documentation endeavors if both Support and Tech Docs had the same resourcing constraints, but as these groups are often separate, efforts in one aren't always mandated by the other.

Reddish then explores the myriad ways that you can measure the impact from documentation:

> * Fewer support calls; lower support costs
> * Less need for training; lower training costs
> * Fewer requests for maintenance; lower repair costs
> * Less time needed for translation; lower translation costs
> * Less downtime for workers
> * Less effort (time, lines of code, rework) needed when technical
communicators are involved early than when they are not
> * Lower costs for writing, paper, printing, etc., because technical
communicators convinced developers that they did not need
all the documentation they were planning
> * Fewer errors in specifications written by technical
communicators than in specifications written by engineers
> * Fewer errors by users
> * Fewer errors by clerks, technicians, or subject-matter specialists
who work on the documents (forms)
> * Fewer forms returned to respondents because of incorrect or
missing answers
> * Fewer grievances
> * Fewer accidents
> * Less waste of materials (Carnevale and Schultz 1990)
> * Less litigation; lower litigation costs (Mauro 1994; Tchobanoff
1997)

Overall, The emphasis on proving ROI is by measuring the impact. Measurement is crucial data needed to prove the value. Bob comments on the need (and difficulty) to measure impact:

> if you can’t measure it, then how do you know you have actually delivered it? Further, if you can’t measure it, how can you show improvement in that—(a) whatever it is, it’s now better and (b) it’s better because of a decision you implemented. That’s a trick question. You can’t. So, how can you measure this? &mdash; [Measuring the value of technical writing](http://docsbydesign.com/2017/08/06/measuring-the-value-of-technical-writing/#_ftn1)

Bob notes that tech writers have been unable to successfully follow through with these measurements, and so the issue of proving value wasn't merely closed with Redish's article in 1995. He notes that measuring tech comm's value is further problematic because we aren't starting with a dire situation where tech docs don't exist and confusion is rampant. Instead, we're already in a pretty good spot. He visually depicts this as follows:

[insert bob's graphic]


A number of other authors have undertaken similar efforts to study the value of tech comm, and articles and books are abundant on this topic.

A 2014 article by Saul Carliner et al on [What Measures of Productivity and Effectiveness Do Technical Communication Managers Track and Report?](https://www.stc.org/techcomm/2014/09/11/what-measures-of-productivity-and-effectiveness-do-technical-communication-managers-track-and-report/) (Tech Comm Journal, 61.3, August 2014) explains the futility of trying to measure tech comm's input. Carliner et al's article seems to move in a substantially new direction of abandoning attempts at measuring financial ROI. The authors explain,

> ... because organizations develop individual communication products to achieve a unique set of objectives, quantifying the value added requires a unique methodology in each situation, one tailored to the specific value proposition of the communication product. As a result, although a general approach exists, no specific, standard methodology for calculating the value added really exists. When performed, these calculations of value require a significant data collection effort and a similarly complex calculation.”
>
> Even when organizations invest this effort, the results are only approximations, as accounting systems that track revenues and expenses can only track transactions that actually occurred. When technical communication products contain expenses, the costs that are saved were never incurred. So the accounting systems have nothing to track. The best that technical communicators can do in such situations is show trends in spending before and after publication of the content to suggest that the cost savings have, indeed, occurred (Carliner, 1998).
>
> Furthermore, organizations often cannot unambiguously attribute that savings to the publication of the technical content. For the oft-cited benefit of technical communication of a reduction in calls to a help line, Spilka (2000) notes that several alternative explanations could exist, such as end users refusing to call because of previous bad experiences with the help desk or finding a helpful co-worker to replace both the help line and the manual (Kay, 2007). Another problem with demonstrating the value added by individual technical communication products and services is that the data can only be collected long after publication, sometimes as long as 6 months to 2 years.

After the authors debunk the idea that you can successfully measure the ROI on tech comm, they look at what managers actually track and report on. When it comes to measuring value, they conclude that

> perceptions are the most significant factor in assessing the value of technical communication products and services, and should be given more focus in future research and writing on this topic

As a result, they discourage any quantitative ROI and instead suggest the following for practitioners:

> When assessing how others in your organization perceive the value of the technical communication services provided by your group, primarily focus on the word-of-mouth flowing through the organization and the quality of the service provided.

I like Carliner et al's approach here. Measuring ROI of tech docs is an impractical idea, but one that keeps resurfacing each time this discussion comes up (for example, at an STC dinner last night, I asked someone questions around this issue, and their first response was to suggest that I start measuring ROI). The volume of research in Carliner et al's article is impressive; these are not just academic opinions, but based on a lot of scholarly research and work.

Imagine an attempt to actually measure ROI. Suppose we have a new complex project but decide not to create any documentation for it. Do we start logging the number of support cases? What happens when support adds some KB content (a form of docs) &mdash; how does that influence the support logs? How do you measure the customers who turned down the project due to poor docs in the first place? How do you measure the time lost from other internal engineers who had to set up extensive meetings to train others on the product? How do you measure the time lost from field engineers who have to hold lengthy client sessions where they configure and set up the product, and then write their own version of instructional notes for customers because there weren't any docs? How do you measure the relative value of different customers &mdash; maybe your one top-earning customer with the largest contract decides to skip the project due to its difficulty, and instead you spend more time with amateur hobby users?

About the only way to really measure the financial ROI of docs is to completely shut off the doc server for about a month, and then measure the number of complaints. But this approach is probably not one that is practical and would amount to a kind of in-house strike that would surely end badly.

In summary, attempting a quantitative approach to measure ROI will likely be unsuccessful; instead, we can shape the perceived value in the minds of leaders. (Note that )

Now that we've explored some of the discussions and research on the topic of a technical writers' value, let's move toward the first premise in our argument: Documentation is valuable to a company's success.

## Premise 1. Documentation is valuable to a company's success

That documentation plays an important and valuable role in a company is usually a premise that goes unquestioned, especially among technical writers. But let's pause a moment and question our assumptions. Is documentation really so valuable?

The other week I walked into our breakroom and stumbled into a conversation (mid-way) in which someone boldly asserted:

> "I have not used the documentation for any product I own for at least the last 10 years."

As it was mid-way and consisting of another team, I lacked some context. But I assume the argument was that the team could skip the need to create documentation for some issue raised by a customer. Or perhaps there was an error or omission in the documentation for an already-shipped product, and the person was downplaying the impact. Either way, the general idea was that documentation wasn't that important, **because not many people use documentation.** The subject of value measured by usage is one that I'll return to.

Regardless of whether people actually use documentation (in any of its forms), what Carliner et al's research teaches us is that *perceptions* matter. The perception that documentation is unused or unimportant, based on one's experience of never using the documentation for the tech gadgets they own (such as an iPhone or printer), devalues documentation as a whole.

What *perceptions* did this person have of documentation? Perhaps in this user's mind, documentation consists of a thick, printed manual, full of useless warnings and legal disclaimers, obvious information, and other irrelevance. Or maybe a single sheet of paper folded sixteen times with 8 different languages, 6pt font, and stuffed into a product package. The user probably doesn't consider each google search for information some form of documentation.

Regardless of perceptions, I admit that in some products, documentation *is* unimportant. Consider a perfectly designed UI for an intuitive product. What need is there for documentation on how to use it? Think about your toaster. A toaster shouldn't need documentation, nor should a great deal of product I own, like a blender or lamp. For many designers, having documentation is an admission of design failure. Again, discard the idea of whether that's true or not. The perception that documentation is evidence of poor design is a readily accepted truth. In fact, the more documentation you need for a product, the worse the design.

[insert graphic]

In fact, one could argue that if documentation is necessary for your product's success, your product will never succeed, because users don't want to read documentation to use your product. Reducing the dependence on documentation, or even eliminating documentation altogether, might be a way to actually force your product to be more intuitive, to stand on its own and be designed well enough not to require a manual. By providing documentation, you're enabling poor design. Get rid of documentation, and we force the design to be better through a kind of sink-or-swim mentality.

In reality, no matter how easy products might aspire to be, there are complexities that cannot be eliminated. It's a designer's utopian dream world but doesn't hold true to reality. Just as we can't jettison support, field engineering, and training (all unnecessary groups in a perfectly intuitive product), we also can't jettison documentation. Additionally, for many developer-centered products, which don't even have a user interface or tangible product, documentation in some ways *is* the product.

## The relationship between usage and value

Having examined assumptions about whether documentation is valuable or not, let's accept that documentation is valuable. Fine, but now how do we argue that value proposition, without any financial ROI data to leverage? Let's return to that overheard breakroom conversation: "I have not used the documentation for any product I own for at least the last 10 years ... [therefore documentation has no value]." To establish value, we just need to flip it around: "Because I have consulted documentation for my products for the last 10 years ... [documentation has value]." Usage determines value.

This is just common sense. For example, in my house, if we don't use something for a period of time, we store it in the garage. After more months of un-use in the garage, we put it in the trash. That which is unused gets thrown away. Value and usage have a direct correlation. It's much easier to argue that documentation is used by a lot of groups, and through this usage, infer that documentation has value by virtue of its usage by this groups.

So we have to build a case for documentation's value by first establishing that **people actually use documentation**. The more people use something, the more valuable it is. Sure, end-users use documentation, but we don't have ready access to them in ways that speak forcibly to business leaders. Instead, we have more direct access to other groups in the company that use documentation. There are primarily 6 groups that use documentation:

* End-users
* Support
* Field engineers
* Marketing
* Training
* Internal engineers

It's probably unnecessary to go into depth about how each of these groups use documentation, as technical writers are intimately familiar with this area. What's important is to show the many ways that these groups use documentation so that leaders within the company have a higher perceived usage of the docs.

Metrics can show clicks on documentation pages, sure. But metrics tend to fall short for a number of reasons. Listing the number of hits on a page is impersonal. They could be search bots, random internet hits for errant keyword matches, or other unknowns.

Additionally, the number of hits don't necessarily matter. If documentation topic "A" gets 1,000 hits from relatively unimportant customers, but documentation topic "B" 1 hit from an important, high-revenue yielding customer, which hit is more important to the business? That 1 hit turns out to be more important, and entire team roadmaps are often built around the needs of these few, high-revenue yielding customers while the masses of other users that don't earn the company much money go ignored. Thus, metrics don't mean much. Whether you get 1,000 clicks or 1 click, it's impossible to translate these clicks into business value.

For example, in my current documentation, the least clicked-on docs from a metrics point of view involve the docs about implementing 4k into your media player. Does this mean we should abandon these docs and focus on the docs that get more clicks (the specifications pages)? Not necessarily. The business may be hungry for more 4k apps, especially as it tries to sell 4k televisions. Suppose just two app developers are working away at 4k media integration into their apps and are relying on the docs for instruction. In this way, the 4k docs pages might be even more important than the specification pages. The point is that metrics alone can't tell the full story about documentation usage in a way that aligns with business value and priorities. Business leaders need to know *who* is using the docs. Which customers, and what is their value to the business?

Without metrics, without ROI numbers, what then do we leverage to establish value from usage? To make a case for documentation's value, it's more effective to get word-of-mouth stories from the groups that matter &mdash; specifically, from the Support, Field Engineering, Marketing, Training, and Internal Engineering groups, since these groups often work directly with high-revenue yielding customers and can speak more directly to the impact there. (Of course, if you have a way of directly tracking and gathering feedback from high-yielding customers, that would also be good data to capture, but in my experience, tech writers rarely have direct access to interface with these customers; it's mostly the field engineers and marketing teams that interact with them.)

To build a case of usage by important groups, technical writers have to interact more directly with each of these groups. You could set up regular meetings to sync with the groups and gather needs and communicate other information. For example, field engineers might explain that they rely on documentation when guiding users through product development. They might even use a real example or two. Metrics alone don't really tell the story of usage, nor do they supply enough ammunition to overcome the perception that documentation isn't used.

Additionally, if tech writers want to **increase the usage** of tech docs, they should more fully interact with these groups (Support, Field Engineering, Marketing, etc.). Too often, technical writers work in isolation, not interacting with other groups much at all. By increasing our interaction with the groups, we can more accurately identify and meet the needs of these groups to make the documentation even more used by the groups.

For example, tech writers can meet regularly with Support to identify trending issues and create documentation to minimize the support load. Tech writers can meet with field engineers to identify most commonly used docs, missing docs, or other common needs field engineers have as they work with users. Tech writers can sync with marketing to make sure blog posts link to supporting documentation for more technical details.

In some ways, these groups are our users, the users we have immediate access to. By better serving their needs, we in turn increase the usage and therein value of docs.

## Information flow

Tech writers can play a two-way communication role, not just gathering information from these groups about their needs, but also funneling information from end-users back to these groups. Tech writers can let internal engineers know what issues and feedback users have. Tech writers can let marketers know what updates and new releases are on the horizon, or what areas are trending in support and which might serve as good blog topics. Tech writers can inform support groups about complex areas in a product and help map escalation workflows with internal engineering teams.

Tech writers have a big picture perspective in an organization that allows them to see across teams and connect the right people together with needed information. Documentation can help foster communication across all of these independent groups. Helping needed information flow across these different groups is another huge value that documentation writers can play. It is not merely a byproduct of docs or a side role to play. This flow of information across all the groups is vital to producing effective documentation. Here we have an activity that benefits all parties mutually here. The more information tech writers move around, the better the docs get. The better the docs get, the higher their usage, and the higher their value.

Additionally, more interactions with these groups invariably leads to higher perceptions of your value to these groups, regardless of any metrics or financial ROI backing up the claim. At the end of the day, it is these perceptions that drive business decisions.

This information flow might even be key to successful companies. Imagine a company where each group is siloed from the others, not communicating or sharing or interacting. In such a company, redundant services, duplicate efforts, decisions made from missing data, etc. probably combine in powerful ways to undermine the company's strategic objectives. For example, it was this kind of siloed information that led the FBI to form a collaborative wiki ("Intellipedia") that would allow better cross-department communication and sharing of information.

> After 9/11, we asked ourselves: why was no one able to connect the dots?(David Ignatius, Associate Editor, The Washington Post). Could 9/11 have been prevented? In a number of crutical cases, mishandled intelligence, bureacratic tangles and legal hurdles blinded the CIA and the FBI to clues right in front of them. Individually, none of these was a smoking gun. But combined they were a four-alarm fire. (Frank 2004). [Knowledge Management in Theory and Practice](https://books.google.com/books?id=_MrxCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA291&lpg=PA291&dq=form+wiki+to+share+information+fbi+cia&source=bl&ots=FhvtVX-VI0&sig=rDJKGo2ykA9oyJKMlKadG4vMEY0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiO-r6K85bYAhVT3GMKHeG2DvAQ6AEIWzAI#v=onepage&q=form%20wiki%20to%20share%20information%20fbi%20cia&f=false). By Kimiz Dakir, Jay Liebowitz.

This is probably a topic for another essay, but it was worth mentioning here because this value informs the tech writing model within an organization. Tech writers should not be siloed, introverted groups with their heads down typing away for months creating docs. It's an interactive group that moves information through many different parts of an organization. This information can be the lifeblood of effective decisions that lead to successful outcomes for a company. Try tracking that!

In the Harvard Business Review, authors Nielson et al explore "The Secrets to Successful Strategic Execution." Ranked number 4 is "Information flows freely across organizational boundaries." The authors relate this cautionary tale that shows the danger of lack of information flow in an organization:

> A cautionary tale comes from a business-to-business company whose customer and product teams failed to collaborate in serving a key segment: large, cross-product customers. To manage relationships with important clients, the company had established a customer-focused marketing group, which developed customer outreach programs, innovative pricing models, and tailored promotions and discounts. But this group issued no clear and consistent reports of its initiatives and progress to the product units and had difficulty securing time with the regular cross-unit management to discuss key performance issues. Each product unit communicated and planned in its own way, and it took tremendous energy for the customer group to understand the units’ various priorities and tailor communications to each one. So the units were not aware, and had little faith, that this new division was making constructive inroads into a key customer segment. Conversely (and predictably), the customer team felt the units paid only perfunctory attention to its plans and couldn’t get their cooperation on issues critical to multiproduct customers, such as potential trade-offs and volume discounts.
> ... as the market became more competitive, customers began to view the firm as unreliable and, generally, as a difficult supplier, and they became increasingly reluctant to enter into favorable relationships. &mdash; [The Secrets to Successful Strategy Execution](https://hbr.org/2008/06/the-secrets-to-successful-strategy-execution)

Who better to unstick companies from this inertia than the very group through which almost every role interacts? Tech writers can play a tremendous role in the information flow in a company &mdash; if we see it as part of the value we add. Our role should not merely be documentation but information flow, which brings me to another transition point &mdash; moving from tech writing to content experience.

There's a trend in the industry for tech writers to expand as *content strategists* that look at every touchpoint the user has with information along his or her journey. The idea is for tech writers to stop focusing singularly on documentation and instead look at how customers interact with content at every touchpoint in both pre- and post-sales scenarios.

This examination of content touchpoints forces users to interact in marketing spaces, support spaces, sales spaces, training spaces, and more. Companies such as MindTouch promote the idea of being a content influencer or content experience professional more than just a technical writer. MindTouch's Ari Hoffman explains that this new, emerging role for technical communications is called "Content Experience". Hoffman describes Content Experience as follows:

> This role is not defined or exclusively owned by Product, Marketing, Sales, Support, or Success. Content Experience often lives in different departments depending on organizational structure, or as an independent vertical that manages all content produced by relevant departments.
>
> Content Experience is the evolution of content strategy blending with technical communication. It’s an understanding that your content provides self-service experiences not only for your customers, but for potential prospects researching and/or buying your product as well.
>
> If you understand how your customers and prospects are accessing, consuming, and sharing your technical content, then you can inform Marketing on campaigns to produce, Sales on strategic talking points, Success on how to scale their efforts, and even Product on weaknesses in the current offering (amongst many many other value props). &mdash; [Announcing 2017’s TOP25 Content Experience Influencers and TOP200 Strategists](https://mindtouch.com/resources/announcing-2017s-top25-content-experience-influencers-top200-strategists)

The more we interact in these other spaces (marketing, training, support, field engineering, and more), the more aware we become of their needs. These needs become actionable items that have ripple effects into the documentation and other communications we produce. We begin to adjust our outputs to serve the needs of these groups in more direct ways. This in turn makes the documentation more valuable to these groups, as they begin to use it more precisely because the documentation more directly meets their needs.

One problem with this expanding influence, as I will return to later, is that budgets usually don't span across groups. If your tech writers are rooted in Group X, why will Group X care about the impact on Groups A, B, and C? Sure, the tech writer can play an influential role in an organization's information flow, but how do you make this shift when your primary responsibility is merely documentation?

## Premise 2: Full-time technical writers play a critical role with documentation

I've argued that documentation provides a valuable asset to a company in so much as documentation is widely used by many groups in the company. Now I want to transition to the next premise: full-time technical writers play a critical role with documentation.

I noted in the introduction that it's not enough to claim docs are valuable. Senior business leaders might concede that docs are valuable, but also argue that more groups should therefore get involved in authoring the content, rather than relying on an official technical writer role. In fact, many trends point to this philosophy as well. In the Write the Docs group, the founders embrace and encourage the term "documentarian" because it makes the authoring and publishing of documentation a task that runs across job titles. From engineers to quality assurance teams to support agents and product managers, all are encouraged to play an active role in contributing to the documentation. When they play these roles, these persons become "documentarians."

There's a good argument for this idea. Who better to write the documentation than the very group that needs it. A support agent who just retrieve some much-needed info from engineering teams already has the info; he or she just needs to incorporate it into the documentation, often as a knowledge-base article that is discoverable along with the other documentation.

The engineer who has a detailed knowledge of a complex operation is perfectly positioned to describe this complexity, as he or she knows the right lingo and concepts to explain it to other engineers. Why throw a technical writer into these scenarios for him or her to try to write the information? After all, users don't really care about your grammar. They just want the information.

The idea appeals to senior leaders as well, because now you no longer need an official army of technical writers to create documentation. You've taken this information need and distributed it to all relevant groups and empowered them with authoring.

If projects require an extensive, dedicated resource for a period of time, why not contract out the work to an external vendor for the duration of the work? A three or six month contract is surely cheaper than hiring and maintaining a full-time technical writer in the long term. The cost can come directly from the project's budget.

Although this model seems enticing, it does not work as envisioned. Here are the main reasons why it fails:

- Lack of ownership leads to content disarray.

- Project-specific contracts foster documentation around new features only.

- Groups writing in isolation don't provide integration of content across product or group lines.
