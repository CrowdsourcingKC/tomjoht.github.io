keywords: value, organizations, information flow, content experience
summary: "Technical writers can also deepen the value of the documentation they create by focusing on areas of complexity. Complexity not only involves articulating the \"string theory\" parts of a system, but also formulating the content in a way that users, regardless of their level, can understand. The task of simplifying complexity can only be achieved by leveraging many perspectives across groups; thus, focusing on simplifying complexity will also achieve goals around enabling information flow and improving the customer experience."

{{site.data.alerts.note}}This is part VI in a six-part essay. Read the previous section, <a href="/2017/12/27/value-of-tech-comm-in-company-part1">Introduction and research  </a> before starting here. {{site.data.alerts.end}}

Earlier in the essay ([part III](/2017/12/27/value-of-tech-comm-in-company-part4)), I argued that given the technical complexity of products, the products can't be simplified to the degree that documentation becomes unnecessary. However, just because documentation can't be discarded, it doesn't mean the documentation is still valuable. There's a great deal of documentation that is simply terrible, including documentation that official "technical writers" create. Documentation may be necessary, so at some level it provides a value, but that value might be so low that few people consider it valuable.

Think of the instructions that accompany your 1040EZ tax form. Necessary, but no one is thankful for the tax instructions, in part because they're confusing and not really helpful.

The reality is that good documentation is extremely difficult to create, and few possess the skills to do it well. The ability to translate complex information into simple, easy-to-understand language that most users (with varying contexts and skill levels) can understand and follow is more difficult than most people assume. For example, consider the following quotations about simplifying complexity:

> The definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple. &mdash; Albert Einstein

> “Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius — and a lot of courage — to move in the opposite direction.” &mdash; E.F. Schumacher

> "Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains." &mdash; Steve Jobs

Either these assertions are just quirky, random things scientists and technologists say, *or not*. Presumably, scientists look for the simple laws (like f=ma or e=mc<sup>2</sup>) that drive more complex phenomena. Technical writers aren't trying to discover laws governing chaos, but we are trying to distill chaos into simple explanations and steps. In these efforts, just grasping the complexity of a system isn't all that's needed; you have to simplify it so that others can easily understand it. That second activity requires another level of intelligence. (If I were a master at this, my essay here would be 1 post instead of 6.)

Consider how hard it is when you have chaotic data, interconnected information, and other multi-faceted processes and details, and you have to sort through it all and reduce the chaos down to a simple expression &mdash; an expression that renders the complex system clear in the minds of the reader, while not undermining its complex nature.

Simplifying complexity requires you to manipulate large amounts of information into patterns that are easy to follow, into an arrangement that makes sense when there isn't any apparent order. You have to organize, reduce or expand, synthesize, and translate a lot of information into a form of knowledge that others can parse through. You're clearing a path in an information jungle.

The emphasis on complexity aligns with Peterson's findings that tech comm is often undervalued because technical writers merely act as grammar editors and formatters. By tackling the areas of complexity, we can re-align our role as driving value. Peterson says,

> Because TPC as knowledge work is essential in the emerging economy of all-edge adhocracies, practitioners must engage in complex documentation and collaborative tasks.

As an example of such complexity, think about someone working on a PhD dissertation and sorting through information from dozens of books, assessing the arguments, data, devising experiments to validate or dismiss ideas. Not only do technical writers gather and absorb large amounts of turbulent information, they have to distill it into a straightforward argument or series of steps that lead users through a system or procedure. It's not an easy task. This kind of higher-level mental processes is what you gain through advanced college degrees and disciplined scholarly study.

We celebrate writers and presenters (like Bill Nye or Neil deGrasse Tyson or Isaac Asimov) who can make complex subjects in physics understandable. For highly complex topics, simplification is literally a skill that requires genius-level abilities. You have to understand the topic on a deep level, almost as a subject matter expert, yet still know how to write for the beginner (thus overcoming the curse of knowledge). You have to know how to select the details that matter, and then arrange them into a story that makes sense for the user's journey and mental model. You have to communicate that complexity without jargon or specialized vocabulary, starting at a point where you don't lose someone, but also engaging the audience at their level.

As a profession, I think we underestimate the degree of difficulty required for simplification. In most cases, technical writers don't possess the skill to simplify complexity in an impressive way. Adding subheadings and numbered steps helps make complex information easier to consume, for sure, but simplifying complexity gets more challenging as the subjects become more complex.

To provide the most value, technical writers shouldn't merely gravitate towards documenting the obvious or easy features in a system. Instead, we should should focus on the areas that are the most complicated for the users. That's where we should live, swimming in that deep, turbulent ocean water where users are drowning.

To put it another way, tech writers should focus on string theory, not on directions to the corner store. (This assumes users struggle to understand string theory and already know where the corner store is.) Clearly, anyone who can explain string theory in a way that's easy to understand will have clear value in an organization, without the need to continually justify this value.

This is where documentation has an opportunity to stand out. Have you ever used documentation and found that, for the areas that are highly complex (to you), the technical writer glosses over the material? This is why Stack Overflow has been so popular &mdash; it focuses on these difficult, often fringe cases missing from docs. Stack Overflow answers the tough questions that technical writers often don't attempt to wrestle. How much more valuable could documentation be if it focused on these areas of user complexity and made them easy to understand? Imagine docs written by Neil deGrasse Tyson or Bill Nye? In my mind, they would reduce the most complex part of a system into understandable prose that connects with users.

## Complexity is relative

The challenge with simplifying complexity is that it's not just a matter of identifying and focusing on areas of complexity without regard to users. It's simplifying areas that *users* find complex. Because complexity is in the eye of the beholder, even something simple for the writer could be complex for the user. (As such, it's probably more helpful to consider user "pain points" instead of complexity, but I've chosen to use "complexity" here because it aligns with the core value proposition of our profession.)

Here's an example of how complexity is relative. Last weekend I visited the Cantor Museum with my wife and two youngest children. On the second floor, there was an activity station for children:

<img src="/images/foldcardhowtosign.jpg"/>

The idea is to fold a piece of paper in a right way as to simulate a book. The station is intended for little children who get bored by the exhibits and need a more hands-on activity. Great, we just fold some paper in a defined pattern, right? Sounds simple. Here are the instructions:

<img src="/images/foldacardinstructions.png"/>

Although it seems easy, it turned out to be quite complicated for the user, which in this case is my 7-year-old, who needed mom to explain it. In contrast, my 11-year-old found it easy and did not need help.

<figure><img src="/images/showing_molly_foldacard.jpg" style="max-width: 100%"/><figcaption>My daughter is at the top of her class for math and is an excellent reader, but she's stuck on the second picture!</figcaption></figure>

Consider the same scenario with the iPhone. For the digital native, few instructions are needed. But for senior citizens like my Dad or others who didn't grow up installing apps on smartphones, it can be quite complex. He is constantly frustrated that his iPhone doesn't seem to have any instructions.

Therefore "complexity" is entirely relative. What's complex to one is simple to another. How do you write for both audiences? How do you even recognize when a subject is complex if it seems intuitive to you?

It's natural to use ourselves as the measure for complexity. If we can follow the instructions and concepts, we assume our audience can as well, but that often turns out to be false. You can't actually know whether something is complex to users without having access to those users! This is yet again another argument that, in order to tackle complexity, we have to interact with other groups that interact with users (Field Engineer, Support) to even identify the areas of complexity.

My larger point here is that complexity has multiple dimensions and depth, and is not an easy challenge. *It is more complex to simplify these Fold-a-Book instructions for a 7-year-old than it might be to explain string theory to a physicist.* If we merely resort to information mechanisms that would make sense to *other adults*, we haven't found a way to transmit the information to the 7-year-old brain and make the child's brain synapses light up with understanding. Just *how do you do that?* It's a complex undertaking.

## Documentation that simplifies complexity

In another essay, I'd like to dive into principles we can use to simplify complexity. But in brief, the kind of documentation that simplifies complexity and has immediate, obvious value might have characteristics like this:

* A natural organization to the content that just makes sense according to the user's journey
* An at-a-glance presentation of all parts that make up the system, giving users the big picture
* The ability to easily zoom out for the big picture, or zoom in for more details
* A google-like search that returns results users want
* Workflow maps that pull users through a complex process step by step
* Visuals such as concept diagrams and workflows that simplify complex ideas
* Short videos to show complex processes in dynamic ways
* Glossaries and glossary tooltips over jargon or other specialized vocabulary
* Quick start guides formatted in attractive ways that users can print
* Hello world tutorials that get users up and running in a beginning-to-end way
* Plain language principles used with sentences to keep them short, readable, and straightforward
* Iteratively tested content with target audiences

## Where do we find the bandwidth?

To produce documentation that simplifies complexity for a range of users, it might take 3-4 times longer than a quick write-up of a procedure. Given the ever-increasing workloads technical writers face, how can we get support for the required time? Are we technical writers forced into sub-par outputs because of quick deadlines (e.g., two weeks before product launch) and onerous product loads (five projects at a time)?

Even if you were to invest the necessary time to bring the grade up to an A, organizations would still undervalue the content. The reason comes back to [Hughes' point about the unconscious incompetence](/2017/12/27/value-of-tech-comm-in-company-part2) of the product teams. Most engineers and product managers don't realize the complexity of their products. They are unaware of their own proficiency and understanding of a topic, so a technical writer who goes to great pains to make these concepts and techniques even more simple and clear isn't going to receive widespread praise and recognition.

In an engineers' mind, technical writers expend a lot of energy documenting information that is somewhat obvious and shouldn't need so much detail. How many times have you heard engineers say, "If users don't understand this, they shouldn't be using it." In their minds, the users are supposed to already have a certain level of knowledge to even use the product. That presumed level of knowledge is what will make the product seem simple to the user.

Because this tacit knowledge abounds in the workplace, both mediocre documentation and outstanding documentation will probably have the same perceived value to the organization. The only solution is for technical writers to assess and argue the documentation's value in context of the users rather than in the context of other internal engineers.

A question about bandwidth remains. Should you continue to try to juggle 5 projects and produce poor, hurried documentation for all of them? If you do, you end up devaluing documentation even more, because the output (which likely doesn't simplify complexity) only confirms preconceptions about the low value of documentation. The cycle feeds on itself. Fewer technical writers are hired because their value is low; as a result, the technical writers churn out material faster, perhaps resigning themselves to editors, publishers, and curators rather than knowledge creators. As a result, they become the "information packagers" that Hughes wrote about. They confirm perceptions that Peterson wrote about in regards to secretarial labor, where technical writers only make documents pretty by removing grammar errors.

On the other hand, suppose you were to draw boundaries around your project scope and limit yourself to 1-2 projects only, but you deliver documentation that has strong value. Perhaps you can then get justification to hire more writers.

Most likely you can't always say no to more projects. One strategy could be to define your role with projects &mdash; working as a knowledge creator for some, but for others, a mere editor. And then clarify this level of engagement with the project team.

## Coming back to value

Do most technical writers overestimate their ability to simplify complexity, which is a skill widely respected, and then complain that no one understands the value of what they produce? If people don't value the documentation, maybe the content isn't achieving its goal. Maybe the content is on par with pretty much anything someone in the organization could write. As a result, senior leaders encourage everyone to write and contribute to the documentation.

Could we end discussions of value by creating documentation that provides value about complexity in an unquestionable way?

## Conclusion

This essay started out as one post and expanded into six, because I kept searching for what I felt was the right answer. In the end, establishing value doesn't mean selecting one direction and ignoring the others. All of these directions are complementary and help you increase the value of documentation. Increasing information flow and looking at all content across the customer experience are essential activities to creating documentation that simplifies complexity. You can't write the kind of genius-level documentation around complex topics that has tremendous value if you operate solely within the boundaries of your own head. You have to interact widely with these other groups to gather and evaluate the needed information. As such, these interactions are prerequisites, not options.

Writing this essay also helped me evaluate an idea I recently encountered. The idea was this: Technical writers might act as mere facilitators of the writing and publishing process; they provide the tools for others in the organization to write and publish technical content. They might step in to ensure the content meets basic standards, but the burden of content creation lies with each project team, not the technical writers.

Such an idea severely shortchanges the knowledge value and role that technical writers can and should play. It perpetuates a secretarial status to technical writers and will surely lead to a devaluation of our role, not to mention a lowering of the knowledge assets of the company. Writing this essay helped me value the important knowledge contributions of my own role and see my effort in the proper light.

## Action items and takeaways

Readers will form their own conclusions and takeaways, but because I started this essay by saying I needed to reconcile the value question for myself, I'll also end it with my own list of takeaways. I have 5 main conclusions:

* Tech writers are a group through which many organizational groups intersect; as such, we can play a pivotal role in improving the customer experience.
* Tech writers provide high corporate value by creating knowledge assets, not by merely editing or publishing information that engineers write. As such, their primary focus should be knowledge creation.
* Tech writers must focus on the complexities (pain points) users face &mdash; they can understand these complexities only by interacting with groups across the organization (such as Field Engineering, Support, and Marketing).
* Tech writers should promote their knowledge assets across organizational lines; this not only improves information flow but also helps promote the tech writer's role and value to these groups.
* Measuring your value through metrics is impractical and ill-advised; it is better to gather word-of-mouth perceptions of your value from groups that use your documentation. These interactions will also help inform tech writers about needs in the documentation.
