{{site.data.alerts.note}}This is part II in a six-part essay. Read the previous section, <a href="/2017/12/27/value-of-tech-comm-in-company-part2">Reviewing past research"</a> before diving in here. {{site.data.alerts.end}}

Before jumping into the value debate, I want to review some of the research that has been done previously. With this topic, the STC's publications has a rich history of study and exploration.

## Value as Financial ROI

Bob Watson has a good introduction to the topic in [Measuring the value of technical writing](http://docsbydesign.com/2017/08/06/measuring-the-value-of-technical-writing/). He comments on research from Ginny Redish in her seminal 1995 article, "Adding Value as a Professional Technical Communicator" (Technical communication, 42(1)). Reddish defines value in terms of measurable return on investment (ROI):

> Managers are interested in the “bottom line”; in costs and benefits, in return on investment. We add value when we contribute to improving an organization’s return on its investment in what we do. In considering this balance, we can focus either on reducing the investment or on improving the return on the investment.

Redish's approach to attempt to measure the value against financial impact follows an argument around concepts of value that would set the general direction around value for many years to come. (However, as we shall later see, this approach doesn't yield practical results.)

Redish properly acknowledges the complexity of measuring ROI. She notes how budgets within organizations are often independent, and savings in one group's budget might not matter if your ROI is calculated in another group's budget. Tech docs probably saves a great deal of money in Support, but if Support and Tech Docs are driven by different budgets, grouped in separate divisions, making arguments about ROI might not resonate with these managers. Redish explains, quoting an earlier publication she co-authored:

> The manager who must get the manual to the printer on a certain schedule and within a certain cost is not responsible for whatever havoc the manual might cause later on (Redish and Selzer 1985, p. 51).

Continuing with the Support versus Tech Docs example, Support might be more invested in documentation endeavors if both Support and Tech Docs had the same resourcing constraints, but as these groups are often separate, efforts in one aren't always mandated by the other.

Reddish then explores the myriad ways that you can measure the impact from documentation:

> * Fewer support calls; lower support costs
> * Less need for training; lower training costs
> * Fewer requests for maintenance; lower repair costs
> * Less time needed for translation; lower translation costs
> * Less downtime for workers
> * Less effort (time, lines of code, rework) needed when technical
communicators are involved early than when they are not
> * Lower costs for writing, paper, printing, etc., because technical
communicators convinced developers that they did not need
all the documentation they were planning
> * Fewer errors in specifications written by technical
communicators than in specifications written by engineers
> * Fewer errors by users
> * Fewer errors by clerks, technicians, or subject-matter specialists
who work on the documents (forms)
> * Fewer forms returned to respondents because of incorrect or
missing answers
> * Fewer grievances
> * Fewer accidents
> * Less waste of materials (Carnevale and Schultz 1990)
> * Less litigation; lower litigation costs (Mauro 1994; Tchobanoff
1997)

Overall, the emphasis on proving the tech writer's value is by measuring the ROI. Bob comments on the need (and difficulty) to measure impact:

> if you can’t measure it, then how do you know you have actually delivered it? Further, if you can’t measure it, how can you show improvement in that—(a) whatever it is, it’s now better and (b) it’s better because of a decision you implemented. That’s a trick question. You can’t. So, how can you measure this? &mdash; [Measuring the value of technical writing](http://docsbydesign.com/2017/08/06/measuring-the-value-of-technical-writing)

Bob notes that tech writers have been unable to successfully follow through with these measurements, and so the issue of proving value wasn't merely closed with Redish's article in 1995.

Bob also adds that measuring tech comm's value is further problematic because we aren't starting with a dire situation where tech docs don't exist and confusion is rampant. Instead, we're already in a pretty good spot. He visually depicts this as follows:

<a href="http://docsbydesign.com/2017/08/06/measuring-the-value-of-technical-writing"><img src="/images/ROI_web.png"/></a>

To really measure the value of tech docs, you'd need a scenario where tech docs are totally absent.

## Value as knowledge creation

A number of other authors have undertaken similar efforts to study the value of tech comm, and articles and books are abundant on this topic. For example, in "Moving from Information Transfer to Knowledge Creation: A New Value Proposition for Technical Communicators" (Technical Communication Journal, Volume 49, Number 3, August 2002), Michael Hughes sees the value proposition of tech comm not merely as information transfer but rather knowledge creation. Knowledge is information in action; it is an interpretation of the information or product within the user's context (hence usually interpreted in the form of actionable tasks).

<figure><img src="images/actionableinformation.png" style="max-width: 400px;"/><figcaption>Hughes shows how technical communicators create knowledge assets from information. Technical communicators don't just translate information into readable prose; they actually create new knowledge assets.</figcaption></figure>

Hughes explains that much of the knowledge inside an organization is tacit, meaning so innate that the engineers assume everyone knows it; this tacit information "enables acts of unconscious competence." On the other end of the stick, users often don't even know what to ask. They are unaware of what they don't know &mdash; they have unconscious incompetence. It is in this space that technical communicators create new knowledge that provides tremendous value.

> technical communicators find themselves between experts who cannot articulate what needs to be known (or even that it exists to be known) and users who do not know to even ask.  &mdash;

The metaphor Hughes' paints is "akin to a psychologist helping a patient unlock a hidden memory." Hughes argues that regardless of whether external users read the documentation, the creation of this knowledge provides a strong value, since this knowledge is what gives companies a competitive advantage. These knowledge assets, which make a company smarter, are what accelerate company growth. Hughes cites research from a book on organizational learning in which the head of planning for Royal Dutch/Shell, assets:

> The ability to learn faster than your competitors may be the only sustainable competitive advantage.

Because knowledge is the lifeblood of an organization, the knowledge assets that technical communicators create can provide a competitive edge for an organization. For example, technical writers might promote this knowledge to inform product design. The contributed knowledge assets may be even more important to the organization than it is to external users. Hughes explains:

> This aspect of technical communicators’ contribution can be even more valuable than the documentation they provide end users. By expanding the technical communicator’s value proposition to include the creation of knowledge assets that improve the competitiveness of the enterprise, his or her value persists regardless of whether end users ever even look at the documentation.

This makes any detailed effort to measure clicks from users on doc pages a futile and misguided attempt to measure the value of documentation. It fundamentally misunderstands the value of knowledge creation that technical communicators contribute to an organization.

Hughes wrote his article when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) *Occupational Outlook Handbook* defined technical writers as professionals who "take technical information and make it understandable to those that need it." Hughes wanted to change the definition to describe technical writers as follows:

> Technical communicators negotiate meaning within development communities and between those communities and user contexts, and they capture the resulting consensus as knowledge assets.

In 2010, the Bureau changed the definition to say technical writers "communicate complex and technical information more easily. They also develop, gather, and disseminate technical information ..." ([Technical writers &mdash; Bureal of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/technical-writers.htm)). In other words, we're not merely "information packagers"; we are "knowledge creators." I'm sure Hughes and others helped transform this definition.

## Value as perceptions from others

A 2014 article by Saul Carliner et al on [What Measures of Productivity and Effectiveness Do Technical Communication Managers Track and Report?](https://www.stc.org/techcomm/2014/09/11/what-measures-of-productivity-and-effectiveness-do-technical-communication-managers-track-and-report/) (Tech Comm Journal, 61.3, August 2014) explains the futility of trying to measure tech comm's input. After undertaking a massive study around metrics and productive measures, with surveys across a broad range of managers in different companies and industries, and then analyzing and rigorously dissecting the results, the authors explain that measuring the financial value of tech comm quantitatively is "not done. And in the few instances when it is performed, the measures that have
been developed are, at best, imprecise." If measurement is done, it's often because upper management asks for it. Managers say word-of-mouth reporting is more common and effective. Carliner et al write:

> ... because organizations develop individual communication products to achieve a unique set of objectives, quantifying the value added requires a unique methodology in each situation, one tailored to the specific value proposition of the communication product. As a result, although a general approach exists, no specific, standard methodology for calculating the value added really exists. When performed, these calculations of value require a significant data collection effort and a similarly complex calculation.”
>
> Even when organizations invest this effort, the results are only approximations, as accounting systems that track revenues and expenses can only track transactions that actually occurred. When technical communication products contain expenses, the costs that are saved were never incurred. So the accounting systems have nothing to track. The best that technical communicators can do in such situations is show trends in spending before and after publication of the content to suggest that the cost savings have, indeed, occurred (Carliner, 1998).
>
> Furthermore, organizations often cannot unambiguously attribute that savings to the publication of the technical content. For the oft-cited benefit of technical communication of a reduction in calls to a help line, Spilka (2000) notes that several alternative explanations could exist, such as end users refusing to call because of previous bad experiences with the help desk or finding a helpful co-worker to replace both the help line and the manual (Kay, 2007). Another problem with demonstrating the value added by individual technical communication products and services is that the data can only be collected long after publication, sometimes as long as 6 months to 2 years.

After the authors debunk the idea that you can successfully measure the ROI on tech comm, they look at what managers actually track and report on.

When it comes to measuring value, they conclude that &mdash;

> The evidence from this study suggests that, instead of quantifiable measures, the most common means of assessing the productivity and effectiveness of technical communicators is word-of-mouth and service quality &mdash; that is, perceptions of the quality and responsiveness of the service provided by technical communicators to the people who hire them, not the users who ultimately benefit from the end products.

The idea that perceptions of quality by the people who hire technical writers, rather than the end users who use the products, carries more weight is fascinating and is an idea that I'll return to later.

Carliner et al discourage any quantitative ROI and instead suggest the following for practitioners:

> When assessing how others in your organization perceive the value of the technical communication services provided by your group, primarily focus on the word-of-mouth flowing through the organization and the quality of the service provided.

Although Carliner et al conclude that measuring ROI of docs is impractical, it's an idea that keeps resurfacing each time this discussion comes up. For example, at a recent STC dinner, I asked someone for their thoughts around the value issue, and their first response was to suggest that I start measuring ROI because that's the only language business managers speak.

Imagine an attempt to actually measure ROI of tech docs. In a perfect experiment, suppose we have a new complex project we're releasing, and as part of our measurement experiment, we eliminate docs for the product for the first month. Do we start logging the number of support cases? What happens when support adds some KB content (a form of docs) &mdash; already we've started to distort our measures. How do you measure the customers who turned down the project due to poor docs in the first place? How do you measure the time lost from other internal engineers who had to set up extensive meetings to train others on the product? How do you measure the time spent by field engineers who have to hold lengthy client sessions where they configure and set up the product, and then write their own version of instructional notes for customers? Now suppose you release docs and measure hits. Even if you're counting up metrics on docs, how do you measure the relative value of the hits based on customer impact? Maybe your one top-earning customer with the largest contract decides to skip the project due to its difficulty, and instead you spend more time with amateur hobby users who flood the forums with questions?

In summary, attempting a quantitative approach to measure ROI will likely be unsuccessful; instead, we should focus on shaping the *perceived value* of docs in the minds of leaders.

## Value from focusing on complex (not secretarial) work

The most recent issue of *Technical Communication* journal explores the value question as well, in Emily January Peterson's "Articulating Value Amid Persistent Misconceptions About Technical and Professional Communication in the Workplace" (Technical Communication, 64.3, AUGUST 2017).

Peterson interviews 39 women in tech comm to see whether others in the company value their role and contributions as technical writers. She finds that many tech writers are essentially treated like secretaries, and their work minimized as merely fixing grammar or other cosmetic improvements. Peterson writes,

> Overall, according to the interview data, TPC [Technical and Professional Communication] is misconceived as cosmetic, secretarial, unarticulated across disciplines, unnecessary, invisible, and unquantifiable, which means such workers often feel expendable.

By "unarticulated," Peterson means the technical writer's improvement or creation of the content isn't noticed. Others assume the tech writer merely got the content that way from engineers. Peterson explains,

> Colleagues may engage with user guides or online help as much as customers do, but they might also think that Shirley’s hand in creating that documentation was unnecessary and, therefore, she is adjunct to the real work of the company and product. She explained that this is frustrating because, “I sit in sales now, and I can hear them talking about my work every single day. That’s part of how they sell the product. … I know they use it.” She sees them using the documentation, but she has also heard that what she does is unnecessary.

Peterson highlights the contributions to knowledge that Hughes argued for. Peterson concludes that tech writers have to make a constant case for their value, correcting stereotypes and misperceptions across disciplines to make their value known and understood. Peterson says "articulation is and must be a continued concern of the field as a whole."

Every time technical writer limit their contributions to correcting grammar only, they perpetuate stereotypes about the low-value we provide.

I've only scratched the surface on research done around value. As I said earlier, this topic has been the dominant theme in tech comm since the beginning. It largely remains unresolved.
