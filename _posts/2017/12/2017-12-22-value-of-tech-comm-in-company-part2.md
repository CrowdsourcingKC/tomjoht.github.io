{{site.data.alerts.note}}This is part II in a three-part essay. Read the previous section, <a href="/2017/12/22/value-of-tech-comm-in-company-part1">Introduction and research</a> before diving in here. {{site.data.alerts.end}}

Now that we've explored some of the discussions and research on the topic of a technical writers' value, let's move toward the first premise in our argument: Documentation derives value through perceived usage.

### Questioning assumptions about the value of docs

That documentation plays an important and valuable role in a company is usually a premise that goes unquestioned, especially among technical writers. But let's pause a moment and question our assumptions. *Is documentation really so valuable?*

The other week I walked into our breakroom and stumbled into a conversation (mid-way) in which someone boldly asserted:

> "I have not used the documentation for any product I own for at least the last 10 years."

As this was another team and I had just walked into the room, I lacked some context. But I assume the argument was that the team could skip the need to create documentation for an issue raised by a customer. Or perhaps there was an error or omission in the documentation for an already-shipped product, and the person was downplaying the impact. Either way, the general idea was that documentation wasn't that important, **because not many people use documentation.** (Determining value through usage is a topic we'll return to shortly.)

Regardless of whether people actually use documentation (in any of its forms, whether printed manuals or google searches), what Carliner et al's research teaches us is that *perceptions* matter. The perception that documentation is unused or unimportant, based on one's experience of never using the documentation for the tech gadgets they own (such as an iPhone or printer), devalues documentation as a whole.

I agree that for some products, documentation *is* unimportant. Consider a perfectly designed UI for an intuitive product. What need is there for documentation on how to use it? Think about your toaster. A toaster shouldn't need documentation, nor should a blender or fan. For many designers, having documentation is an admission of design failure. Again, discard the idea of whether that's true or not. The perception that documentation is only needed because the design is poor is a readily accepted truth. In fact, the more documentation you need for a product, the worse the design.

One could argue that if documentation is necessary for your product's success, your product will never succeed, because users don't want to read documentation to use your product. Reducing the dependence on documentation, or even eliminating documentation altogether, might be a way to actually force your product to be more intuitive, to stand on its own and be designed well enough not to require a manual. By providing documentation, you're enabling poor design. Get rid of documentation, and you force the design to be better through a kind of sink-or-swim mentality.

So is all documentation, then, not valuable? No. What holds true for some easy, intuitive products can't be applied to the technology landscape as a whole with its vast, robust array of complex products. No matter how easy products might aspire to be, there are complexities that cannot be eliminated. It's a designer's utopian dream world but doesn't hold true to reality. Just as we can't discard support, field engineering, and training &mdash; all unnecessary groups in a perfectly intuitive product &mdash; we also can't discard documentation. For many developer-centered products, which don't have a user interface or tangible product, documentation in some ways *is* the product interface.

### The relationship between usage and value

Having examined assumptions about whether documentation is valuable or not, let's accept that documentation is valuable. Fine, but now how do we argue that value proposition, without any financial ROI data to leverage? Let's return to that overheard breakroom conversation: "I have not used the documentation for any product I own for at least the last 10 years ... [therefore documentation has no value]." To establish value, we just need to flip it around: "Because I have used documentation for my products for the last 10 years ... [documentation has value]." **Usage has a relationship to value.**

This is just common sense. For example, in my house, if we don't use something for a period of time, we store it in the garage. After more months of un-use in the garage, we put it in the trash. That which is unused gets thrown away. Value and usage have a direct correlation. It's much easier to argue that documentation is used by a lot of groups, and through this usage, infer that documentation has value by virtue of its usage by this groups. If it didn't have value, why would they use it?

So we have to build a case for documentation's value by first establishing that **people actually use documentation**. The more people use something, the more valuable it is. Sure, end-users use documentation, but we don't have ready access to them in ways that speak forcibly to business leaders. Instead, we have more direct access to other groups in the company that use documentation. There are primarily 6 groups within a company that use documentation:

* Support
* Field engineers
* Marketing
* Training
* Internal engineers
* UX design

<img src="/images/intersecting_groups-01.svg"/>

It's probably unnecessary to go into depth about how each of these groups use documentation, as technical writers are intimately familiar with this area. What's important is to show the many ways that these groups use documentation so that leaders within the company have a higher perceived usage of the docs.

The obvious starting point to show usage is through web analytics (e.g., hits on pages). However, metrics tend to fall short for a number of reasons. Listing the number of hits on a page is impersonal. The hits could be search bots, random internet hits for errant keyword matches, or other unknowns. They could be hits by the wrong audience.

Additionally, the number of hits on doc pages don't necessarily matter. If documentation topic "A" gets 1,000 hits from relatively unimportant customers, but documentation topic "B" 1 hit from an important, high-revenue yielding customer, which hit is more important to the business? That 1 hit turns out to be more important, and entire team roadmaps are often built around the needs of these few, high-revenue yielding customers while the masses of other users that don't earn the company much money go ignored. Thus, metrics don't mean much. Whether you get 1,000 clicks or 1 click, it's impossible to translate these clicks into business value.

For example, in my current documentation, the least clicked-on docs from a metrics point of view involve the docs about implementing 4k into your media player. Does this mean we should abandon these docs and focus on the docs that get more clicks (the specifications pages)? Not necessarily. The business may be hungry for more 4k apps, especially as it tries to sell 4k televisions. Suppose just two app developers are working away at 4k media integration into their apps and are relying on the docs for instruction. In this way, the 4k docs pages might be even more important than the specification pages. The point is that metrics alone can't tell the full story about documentation usage in a way that aligns with business value and priorities. Business leaders need to know *who* is using the docs. Which customers, and what is their value to the business? Google Analytics can't tell that story.

Without metrics, without ROI numbers, what then do we leverage to establish value from usage? To make a case for documentation's value, as Carliner et al write, it's more effective to get word-of-mouth stories from the groups that matter &mdash; specifically, from the Support, Field Engineering, Marketing, Training, and Internal Engineering groups, since these groups often work directly with high-revenue yielding customers and can speak more directly to the impact there. (Of course, if you have a way of directly tracking and gathering feedback from high-yielding customers, even better.)

To build a case of usage by important groups, technical writers have to interact more directly with each of these groups. You could set up regular meetings to sync with the groups and gather needs and communicate other information. For example, field engineers might explain that they rely on documentation when guiding users through product development. They might even use a real example or two. Gathering this anecdotal, word-of-mouth feedback about the value of docs based on these groups' usage is the goal, but it won't make a slam-dunk argument for the value of docs.

## What is valuable doesn't always have value

My argument so far is that docs derive value through usage from important groups. However, this argument also falls somewhat short. A philosopher would object and say, not everything that is valuable has value. Consider, for example, the air. Sure it's valuable, but it doesn't have market value (not yet anyway -- wait another 30 years when pollution makes air unbreathable). If supply of air is infinite, how does it have any "exchange value" in a market?

It's important to establish not only that docs have value, but that their value is greater than something else in an organization. Consider the case of a photocopier in a department. Suppose one day the manager says, you know what, this photocopier costs $10,000 a year, not to mention repair costs each time is breaks down, and I think we can save money by getting rid of it. The employees object, saying, "But we make photocopies daily! We print documents that need signatures, we print faxes, we need to print documents for review and annotation, to make copies for agreements, and so on. Sure, the photocopier gets used a ton and has value.

Then the manager says, would you rather use the $10,000 in our budget for a new copier, or for a new watercooler, expanded fridgerator, and espresso coffee machine? At this point, the question of value becomes relative. Both the photocopier and the watercooler / larger fridge / espresso machine would both be used abundantly. Both have value &mdash; that's not the question. The question is which has more value to the people? In this case, I would choose the watercooler, fridge, and espresso machine over the photocopier. After all, almost everything is digital anyway, and I'd rather have good coffee.

The same argument could be leveraged against technical writers. Sure, the business values documentation, and all of these groups use it. It's not a question of the value of docs, but degrees of competing value. Would you rather have a the needed functionality in your application that many customers are complaining about, or would you rather have better documentation?

Hmmm. You can see now how my argument about value from high usage is starting to fall apart. We are now debating which company resources have more value. And here, if we limit the tech writing role to simply that of writing documentation, I fear tech writers will lose. Application functionality is usually much sexier, more attractive, and leads to higher sales than documentation. *We do need an API for our product. That's what our customers have been asking for. I know our docs are poor, but we really need the API. And since I only have budget to hire one resource...*
