## Introduction

When managers want headcount for a job requisition (whether expanding or backfilling), or when senior execs start rebalancing the workforce, the longstanding, sensitive issue of the tech writer's value moves back into the spotlight. Should we open another tech writer position? Should we backfill the position? Why? What measurable value do tech writers provide?

The value question becomes especially poignant for technical writers because our very jobs are at stake. It's not simply a matter of which authoring tool to use. Additionally, the meaningfulness of our work is challenged by these questions. If tech writers are deemed to add little value, it suggests our career is unimportant.

Given the lengthy period of time this question has been debated in the tech comm industry (potentially since the beginning), and the many articles written, what can I add? Regardless of whether I add original insights, I hope to make sense of the value debate for myself, for my own role and company dynamics. Conclusions about value inform the tech writing model within a company; they inform my daily activities and focus, how I prioritize and orchestrate my work, how I interact with other groups, and more.

In this essay, I'll explore these questions:

* What is the value tech writers provide to a company?
* How does this value inform the tech writing model in an organization?
* Why is it so difficult to communicate the value of what we do?
* How should tech writers position their value to senior leaders?

I'll break this essay into several parts to make it more digestible online.

## Argument overview

In a nutshell, my argument goes something like this:

* Documentation is valuable. It derives this value not from a carefully measured financial ROI, which is impractical to measure, but from perceived value by the many groups within the company (not to mention end users) that use documentation.
* Even though documentation has value (as determined by usage), it might not have more value relative to other resources in an organization. Technical writers who limit their value to documentation deliverables only will find that cost analyses of their work will lead to outsourcing the doc to external vendors.
* Technical writers can add more value by encouraging information flow across disparate groups within an organization (such as Support, Engineering, Marketing, Training, Field Engineering, and more). Encouraging two-way communication not only empowers these groups with better information, it also encourages them to share feedback and input that dramatically improves to documentation as well. Incorporate the input helps meet their needs and encourages greater doc usage.
* Complementary to information flow, influencing the content experience across all customer touchpoints is another role technical writers can play to add more value. This movement is a strong trend in the tech comm industry.

Note that my first premise is that *documentation* has value, not that technical writers have value. It is a non-sequitur that if documentation has value, technical writers are necessary. Conceivably, anyone in the organization can write documentation. A business leader can believe that documentation is valuable but not concede that tech writers are necessary to create it.

Therefore, I need to also make a case that not only is documentation valuable, but that technical writers are essential for creating this documentation. And not just technical writers who are external contractors or vendors hired to create documentation on a per project basis (which they abandon after the contract ends), but full-time technical writers engaged for the long-term.

## Past research on tech writer value

Before jumping into the value debate, I want to review some of the research that has been done previously. Bob Watson has a good introduction to the topic in [Measuring the value of technical writing](http://docsbydesign.com/2017/08/06/measuring-the-value-of-technical-writing/). He mainly cites research from Ginny Redish in a seminal 1995 article, "Adding Value as a Professional Technical Communicator" (Technical communication, 42(1)). Reddish defines value in terms of measurable return on investment (ROI):

> Managers are interested in the “bottom line”; in costs and benefits, in return on investment. We add value when we contribute to improving an organization’s return on its investment in what we do. In considering this balance, we can focus either on reducing the investment or on improving the return on the investment.

Redish's approach to attempt to measure the value against the bottom line follows a typical argument around concepts of value. (However, as we shall later see, this approach doesn't yield practical results.) Redish properly acknowledges the complexity of measuring ROI. She notes how budgets within organizations are often independent, and savings in one group's budget might not matter if your ROI is calculated in another group's budget. Tech docs probably saves a great deal of money in Support, but if Support and Tech Docs are driven by different budgets, grouped in separate divisions, making arguments about ROI might not resonate with these managers. Redish explains, quoting an earlier publication she co-authored:

> The manager who must get the manual to the printer on a certain schedule and within a certain cost is not responsible for whatever havoc the manual might cause later on (Redish and Selzer 1985, p. 51).

Continuing with the Support versus Tech Docs example, Support might be more invested in documentation endeavors if both Support and Tech Docs had the same resourcing constraints, but as these groups are often separate, efforts in one aren't always mandated by the other.

Reddish then explores the myriad ways that you can measure the impact from documentation:

> * Fewer support calls; lower support costs
> * Less need for training; lower training costs
> * Fewer requests for maintenance; lower repair costs
> * Less time needed for translation; lower translation costs
> * Less downtime for workers
> * Less effort (time, lines of code, rework) needed when technical
communicators are involved early than when they are not
> * Lower costs for writing, paper, printing, etc., because technical
communicators convinced developers that they did not need
all the documentation they were planning
> * Fewer errors in specifications written by technical
communicators than in specifications written by engineers
> * Fewer errors by users
> * Fewer errors by clerks, technicians, or subject-matter specialists
who work on the documents (forms)
> * Fewer forms returned to respondents because of incorrect or
missing answers
> * Fewer grievances
> * Fewer accidents
> * Less waste of materials (Carnevale and Schultz 1990)
> * Less litigation; lower litigation costs (Mauro 1994; Tchobanoff
1997)

Overall, the emphasis on proving the tech writer's value is by measuring the ROI. Bob comments on the need (and difficulty) to measure impact:

> if you can’t measure it, then how do you know you have actually delivered it? Further, if you can’t measure it, how can you show improvement in that—(a) whatever it is, it’s now better and (b) it’s better because of a decision you implemented. That’s a trick question. You can’t. So, how can you measure this? &mdash; [Measuring the value of technical writing](http://docsbydesign.com/2017/08/06/measuring-the-value-of-technical-writing)

Bob notes that tech writers have been unable to successfully follow through with these measurements, and so the issue of proving value wasn't merely closed with Redish's article in 1995.

Bog also adds that measuring tech comm's value is further problematic because we aren't starting with a dire situation where tech docs don't exist and confusion is rampant. Instead, we're already in a pretty good spot. He visually depicts this as follows:

<a href="http://docsbydesign.com/2017/08/06/measuring-the-value-of-technical-writing"><img src="/images/ROI_web.png"/></a>

To really measure the value of tech docs, you'd need a scenario where tech docs are totally absent.

A number of other authors have undertaken similar efforts to study the value of tech comm, and articles and books are abundant on this topic. A 2014 article by Saul Carliner et al on [What Measures of Productivity and Effectiveness Do Technical Communication Managers Track and Report?](https://www.stc.org/techcomm/2014/09/11/what-measures-of-productivity-and-effectiveness-do-technical-communication-managers-track-and-report/) (Tech Comm Journal, 61.3, August 2014) explains the futility of trying to measure tech comm's input. In abandoning attempts at measuring financial ROI, Carliner et al's article seems to move in a substantially new direction. The authors explain:

> ... because organizations develop individual communication products to achieve a unique set of objectives, quantifying the value added requires a unique methodology in each situation, one tailored to the specific value proposition of the communication product. As a result, although a general approach exists, no specific, standard methodology for calculating the value added really exists. When performed, these calculations of value require a significant data collection effort and a similarly complex calculation.”
>
> Even when organizations invest this effort, the results are only approximations, as accounting systems that track revenues and expenses can only track transactions that actually occurred. When technical communication products contain expenses, the costs that are saved were never incurred. So the accounting systems have nothing to track. The best that technical communicators can do in such situations is show trends in spending before and after publication of the content to suggest that the cost savings have, indeed, occurred (Carliner, 1998).
>
> Furthermore, organizations often cannot unambiguously attribute that savings to the publication of the technical content. For the oft-cited benefit of technical communication of a reduction in calls to a help line, Spilka (2000) notes that several alternative explanations could exist, such as end users refusing to call because of previous bad experiences with the help desk or finding a helpful co-worker to replace both the help line and the manual (Kay, 2007). Another problem with demonstrating the value added by individual technical communication products and services is that the data can only be collected long after publication, sometimes as long as 6 months to 2 years.

After the authors debunk the idea that you can successfully measure the ROI on tech comm, they look at what managers actually track and report on. When it comes to measuring value, they conclude that &mdash;

> perceptions are the most significant factor in assessing the value of technical communication products and services, and should be given more focus in future research and writing on this topic

As a result, they discourage any quantitative ROI and instead suggest the following for practitioners:

> When assessing how others in your organization perceive the value of the technical communication services provided by your group, primarily focus on the word-of-mouth flowing through the organization and the quality of the service provided.

I like Carliner et al's approach here. Measuring ROI of tech docs is an impractical idea, but one that keeps resurfacing each time this discussion comes up. (For example, at a recent STC dinner, I asked someone for their thoughts around this issue, and their first response was to suggest that I start measuring ROI because that's the only language business managers speak.) The volume of research in Carliner et al's article is impressive; these are not just academic opinions, but based on a lot of scholarly research and work. They conclude that attempts at measurement aren't practical or effective.

Imagine an attempt to actually measure ROI of tech docs. Suppose we have a new complex project but decide not to create any documentation for it. Do we start logging the number of support cases? What happens when support adds some KB content (a form of docs) &mdash; already we've started to distort our measures. How do you measure the customers who turned down the project due to poor docs in the first place? How do you measure the time lost from other internal engineers who had to set up extensive meetings to train others on the product? How do you measure the time lost from field engineers who have to hold lengthy client sessions where they configure and set up the product, and then write their own version of instructional notes for customers because there weren't any docs? Even if you're counting up metrics about hits on docs, how do you measure the relative value of the hits based on customer impact? Maybe your one top-earning customer with the largest contract decides to skip the project due to its difficulty, and instead you spend more time with amateur hobby users who flood the forums with questions.

About the only way to really measure the financial ROI of docs is to completely shut off the doc server for about a month, and then measure the number of complaints. But this approach is probably not one that is practical and would amount to a kind of in-house strike that would surely end badly.

In summary, attempting a quantitative approach to measure ROI will likely be unsuccessful; instead, we should focus on shaping the *perceived value* of docs in the minds of leaders.
