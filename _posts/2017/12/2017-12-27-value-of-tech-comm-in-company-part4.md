summary: "Technical writers can add more value by encouraging information flow across disparate groups within an organization (such as Support, Engineering, Marketing, Training, Field Engineering, and more). Encouraging information flow not only empowers these groups with better knowledge, it also encourages them to share feedback and input that dramatically improves the documentation. However, information flow alone is too tenuous of a value to attribute to technical writers, and probably only applies in large organizations."

{{site.data.alerts.note}}This is part IV in a five-part essay. Read the previous section, <a href="/2017/12/27/value-of-tech-comm-in-company-part3">Determining value through usage</a> before diving in here. {{site.data.alerts.end}}

Our argument about the value of documentation has taken on some difficult obstacles. It's not enough that documentation has value through perceived high usage among important groups, because so do other resources in the organization. Both the photocopier and espresso machine have high usage among in the company, but with a finite budget, how do we chose? We still haven't proved that documentation has a higher value than some other needed company resource.

## Docs aren't the espresso machine

One problem is that documentation as an asset aren't sexy &mdash; they don't have a high value or esteem in an organization. People dislike the very idea of docs. As mentioned earlier, for UX designers, the very inclusion of docs suggests a failure in design. For product managers, the idea that their product (which is supposed to be easy and intuitive/simple to use) should actually require a lot of documentation also suggests failure. Your product needed help for users to understand it? Oh, it needed docs, like a cripple needs a crutch. Users, too, do not welcome a hefty user guide in a welcome light. Just as the almighty thud would fill users with dread in the days of print, infinite online pages overwhelm users with a sense of distaste as well.

If docs are our only contribution, will we ever rise above our low place on the totem pole of value? Can we move past the idea that the technical writer merely contributes documentation? Why should we do that, and what would these additional avenues of value look like?

## Outsourcing doc needs

If the only value technical writers provide to an organization is documentation, their value may eventually be outsourced. I once worked for a non-profit corporation in Utah where we tracked our time against various cost centers. For example, if you worked 3 hours on Project X for the day, you entered this into a time tracking spreadsheet, applying the 3 hours toward Department X. Inside the corporation, each department had a certain budget of how much they could spend. Our time spent on documentation for their department was applied against their budget.

We thought the setup was just some annoying accounting group trying to track spending. But one day, the company announced that they were laying off *all* the technical writers (in addition to about 7% of the total IT workforce). This shocked us. I didn't think they would remove an entire function within an organization. Maybe 1-2 writers, but not *everyone*, and surely not me. But alas, it was true. *Audios, amigos!*

In retrospect, I think this is what happened. Behind the scenes, some bow-tie-wearing, clever accountant was doing an internal-versus-external cost analysis, similar to a buy-versus-build cost analysis. Was it cheaper to employ full time technical writers at, say, $80 an hour, or to outsource technical writing needs to an external vendor for $60 an hour? The decision must have been to choose outsourcing because it was less expensive, and you still got documentation in the end.

The corporation provided generous compensation packages, and I made my way to California and started a new life there. Over time, I learned that the corporation hired many of the tech writer employees it laid off as long-term external vendors, and paid them more than they were earning as salaried employees. Some departments even re-hired full-time technical writers on an individual basis (rather than having a centralized tech writing team). So clearly, the decision to outsource as a way to cut expenses was not a slam-dunk for cost savings as the accountant had hoped. Why not?

The main reason is because, ultimately, the documentation wasn't the only value the tech writers provided. Contract technical writers are contracted to provide one service: documentation. Because the contractor's role is fixed around this end, the contractor can cheapen the rate, charging only $60 an hour and coming across as less expensive than the full-time salaried technical writer. But the contract technical writer is not going to provide any of the extra services that are typically included in the salaried technical writer's role. The contract technical writer will write only the needed documentation topics as specified by the contract. These additional services not included by the contractor might be as follows:

* Logging bugs when identified in the product
* Providing user interface feedback for a product
* Analyzing trending support logs by providing documentation and other information to plug the gaps
* Testing out end-to-end workflows with sample apps
* Setting up and maintaining the authoring and publishing systems
* Maintaining existing documentation over the life of the product with each new release
* Informing other groups, across organizational boundaries, about relevant projects and information
* Channeling feedback from users back to internal engineering teams to improve designs
* Training field engineers on new functionality
* Meeting with field engineers to gather input about user pain points, and then relaying those pain points back to engineering teams and UX designers to improve the product
* Working with Marketing groups to review upcoming blog posts and ensure the information syncs with the documentation harmoniously
* Staying abreast of industry trends around the product to identify information needs in the documentation, and so on.

Contractors avoid these additional tasks because these activities drain their time, and they agreed only to write the given documentation. Salaried technical writers tend to perform these other activities, though they often don't get credit for them and so they goes unnoticed.

## Thought experiment with selling documentation

If the tech writer's only value is to provide documentation, that tech writer will eventually be outsourced because it's simply cheaper to get documentation from an outside vendor. To make my argument, follow this thought experiment.

Suppose you were to start selling documentation as a product to other groups in the company who need it. You need documentation for Project X? All right, based on the estimated 50 pages needed, we will charge $16,000 for the documentation. (50 pages x 4 hrs per page X $80/hr = $16,000.)

This might seem like an ingenious way to assign a direct value to documentation. It would tell you exactly how much your documentation is worth, right? If they won't pay the money, documentation isn't worth this much. But you hope they will pay it, because surely they can't dispense with documentation.

But now Department X starts doing some research. Although your tech writing team wants to charge $16,000, they find that a contractor will do it for $10,000. This becomes a no-brainer. They just saved $6,000, which they can use to pay a software engineer intern to do even more work.

I'd love to find examples of tech comm groups that actually started charging for docs to see if my thought experiment is correct. But my point is this: It's not enough to just provide documentation. Tech writers must provide additional value to the organization. Where might this additional value come from? One benefit might be to foster **information flow** within the organization.

## The value of information flow

What do I mean by information flow? Consider the graphic I previously used to show the many groups that use documentation. Now let's pivot the graphic to show how information might flow through these same groups.

<img src="/images/intersecting_groups_information_flow.svg"/>

Because technical writers are at the intersection of these groups, we are poised to enable information flow in a powerful way. We don't just document the needed information and publish it; we channel it to the right group that needs it, and to pull information from other groups that have it. We connect information across groups, bringing information through these pipelines and pulling together the right people into conversations.

In earlier research I cited the work on value by Emily January Peterson. She noted

> Practitioners know that TPC crosses boundaries and is therefore networked in a way that no other profession currently is.

If tech comm is networked in deeper ways than any other profession, can we use that deep networking to leverage additional forms of value?

Hughes also noted that dissemination of the knowledge assets we create is a natural action for technical communicators to take:

> Technical communicators who see themselves as creators of knowledge think beyond the concept of documentation and think in terms of knowledge management systems. Writing becomes a secondary and subordinate activity to content management. The user community becomes just one of many stakeholders who can benefit from the knowledge the technical communicator has created, and the technical communicator seeks ways to distribute that knowledge to all the stakeholders—for example, marketing, operations, engineering, and so forth.

Here's an example. I'm currently creating documentation for the APK upload process with app submission. I'm pulling information from trends identified by Support. I'm also interacting with field engineers to identify issues with APKs for the customers they work with. As I improve the documentation around APK uploading, I'll channel the feedback to the UX team, who is redesigning this area of the submission console. I'll also let engineers know what specific pain points users have with the APK processing. When I finish the docs, I'll let Marketing know so they can potentially highlight the new design as an incentive to show continued improvement for app developers. Business development can benefit from knowing that some previous issues have been resolved or clarified, so that they can speak more persuasively to prospective clients. I'll also let Support know about the updates so their forum responses can leverage the new content. All of this chatter will surely draw Ccs and input from people I don't even know should be involved or have input.

As a technical writer, I can foster this conversation because all of these groups the documentation gives me a common point of intersection. The work I'm doing has some relevance to all of them, and I can involve them, get information from them, and connect them with each other in conversation-enabling ways and therein make information flow.

In the most recent issue of *Tech Comm Journal*, Sarah Martin et al argue that technical communicators are in a key position to provide organizational value due to their intersection with other groups:

> Wilson and Wolford (2017) remind us that TCs are “almost always located at the nexus of data, language, and meaning, trafficking in expanding economies of information within organizations” (p. 5). As such, TCs, through their user-centered approach, can add value to a variety of workplace initiatives (Dubinsky, 2004). [Promoting User Advocacy to Shift Technical Communication Identity and Value](https://www.stc.org/techcomm/2017/11/01/promoting-user-advocacy-to-shift-technical-communication-identity-and-value/)

Their focus is on playing user advocate roles with user experience design, but tech writers can play many more roles as well.

Too often, technical writers work in isolation, not interacting with other groups much at all. We sometimes accept this interactivity by dismissing ourselves as introverts. (Maybe in our minds, we imagine ourselves as a writer sequestered away in a remote, isolated cabin working on a novel for years?) But it shouldn't be like this. Technical writers can be the primary force behind information flow within an organization. By increasing our interaction with the groups, we can not only inform them, but more accurately identify and meet their needs. Tech writers have a big picture perspective in an organization that allows them to see across teams and connect the right people together with needed information.

Helping needed information flow across these different groups is not merely a byproduct of docs or a side role to play. This flow of information across all the groups actually helps technical writers create better documentation, because it elicits input from these other groups in ways that will dramatically inform and improve the documentation. The more information tech writers move around, the better the docs get. The better the docs get, the more they empower others to be powerful in their roles. The docs have empowered these other groups with better tools.

More interactions with these groups leads to higher perceptions of your value to these groups, regardless of any metrics or financial ROI backing up the claim. Remember, at the end of the day, it is these perceptions that matter and drive business decisions.

## The value of information flow

Information flow is a key to successful companies. Imagine a company where each group is siloed from the others, not communicating or sharing or interacting. In such a company, the consequences of these siloes play out in redundant services, duplicate efforts, decisions made from missing data, etc. &mdash; the lack of information can undermine the company's strategic objectives.

For example, many analysts blame 9/11 on shortcomings in the information flow within intelligence agencies. Each group's inability to share information within the organization led to blindness in recognizing warning signs that were occurring.

> After 9/11, we asked ourselves: why was no one able to connect the dots? (David Ignatius, Associate Editor, The Washington Post). Could 9/11 have been prevented? In a number of critical cases, mishandled intelligence, bureaucratic tangles and legal hurdles blinded the CIA and the FBI to clues right in front of them. Individually, none of these was a smoking gun. But combined they were a four-alarm fire. (Frank 2004). [Knowledge Management in Theory and Practice](https://books.google.com/books?id=_MrxCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA291&lpg=PA291&dq=form+wiki+to+share+information+fbi+cia&source=bl&ots=FhvtVX-VI0&sig=rDJKGo2ykA9oyJKMlKadG4vMEY0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiO-r6K85bYAhVT3GMKHeG2DvAQ6AEIWzAI#v=onepage&q=form%20wiki%20to%20share%20information%20fbi%20cia&f=false). By Kimiz Dakir, Jay Liebowitz.

To fix the issue, they encouraged information flow by creating a collaborative wiki ("Intellipedia") that would allow better cross-department communication and sharing of information. We're not looking for signs of terrorist activity in an organization, but surely

If information flow is a high-value benefit of technical writers, this goal should inform the way we go about documentation roles. In the *Harvard Business Review*, authors Nielson et al explore "The Secrets to Successful Strategic Execution." One of the principles of strategic execution is that "Information flows freely across organizational boundaries." The authors relate this anecdote that shows the danger of lack of information flow in an organization:

> A cautionary tale comes from a business-to-business company whose customer and product teams failed to collaborate in serving a key segment: large, cross-product customers. To manage relationships with important clients, the company had established a customer-focused marketing group, which developed customer outreach programs, innovative pricing models, and tailored promotions and discounts. But this group issued no clear and consistent reports of its initiatives and progress to the product units and had difficulty securing time with the regular cross-unit management to discuss key performance issues. Each product unit communicated and planned in its own way, and it took tremendous energy for the customer group to understand the units’ various priorities and tailor communications to each one. So the units were not aware, and had little faith, that this new division was making constructive inroads into a key customer segment. Conversely (and predictably), the customer team felt the units paid only perfunctory attention to its plans and couldn’t get their cooperation on issues critical to multiproduct customers, such as potential trade-offs and volume discounts.
> ... as the market became more competitive, customers began to view the firm as unreliable and, generally, as a difficult supplier, and they became increasingly reluctant to enter into favorable relationships. &mdash; [The Secrets to Successful Strategy Execution](https://hbr.org/2008/06/the-secrets-to-successful-strategy-execution)

Who better to unstick companies from this inertia than the very group through which almost every role interacts? Tech writers can play a tremendous role in the information flow in a company &mdash; if we see it as part of the value we add. As such, tech writers should not be siloed, introverted groups with their heads down typing away for months creating docs. We should see ourselves as an interactive group that moves information through many parts of an organization, connecting groups together and making the right parties aware of the information they need. This information can be the lifeblood of effective decisions that lead to successful outcomes for a company.

In a job description for technical writers at Google, the description reads:

> Technical writers play a big part at Google. They are a key link between engineers, marketing associates, developer advocates, as well as all the external users and developers, tying together many vital but disparate parts of the Google ecosystem. ([careers.google.com](https://careers.google.com/jobs?src=Online/Job+Board/indeed&utm_source=indeed&utm_medium=jobaggr&utm_campaign=freeaggr#!t=jo&jid=/google/technical-writer-user-documentation-google-building-41-1600-amphitheatre-2738990359))

How do technical writers play a key link between the disparate parts of a company's ecosystem? Clearly, the documentation role by its very nature connects these groups together.

Note that, the larger the organization, the more such a role becomes relevant. A small startup doesn't have nearly the same information flow needs as a technology giant. But as companies get larger, like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others, linking together these groups becomes key.

Let's return to the scenario of the poor photocopy machine that is likely going to be replaced by the new larger fridge, watercooler, and espresso machine in the breakroom. The photocopier's original function was to provide documents &mdash; scans, copies, faxes, etc., of important agreements, proposals, and other documents for review, annotation, signing, and so on.

What if the photocopier didn't just perform these document-related functions but also did something more? Already, all employees in the department send jobs to the photocopier by way of the network through a printer queue. The photocopier just happens to be the intersection point through which nearly every employee's work flows. Suppose the printer's job-queue software gets an enhancement that amplifies its intelligence about jobs processed. The software captures the document title, metadata, and sender, and then performs some comparison analysis on this print jobs to match up similar document titles with senders. And not just within the same department, but across the entire company?

Each manager can access a report of documents flowing through the system to see what types of documents are coming through, who is sending them, and more importantly, where similar roles and documents overlap across the entire organization.

Now that photocopier versus fridge / watercooler / espresso machine decision is a lot more complicated. This photocopier has a potentially interesting ability to deliver strategic information to the organization. The department manager, Cornelius, is curious to know what Max is printing so frequently  in the copy room, but more importantly, he's interested to know if other groups handle NDA agreements, and how they process them, because it's a major slow-down in his group. They have to route them through several legal bureaucrats before round-tripping them to customers, and it's insane. Just maybe the photocopier's network and job intelligence can give him some insight, gleaned from other NDA-processing groups, that will help him become a better manager.

Still going for the fridge / watercooler / espresso machine? Or are you now leaning towards the photocopier?

Enabling information flow is can be a value that provides strategic enablement in an organization. But it's a little hard to measure, and the task doesn't entirely connect in with the technical writers main skillset, which involves content development. How can we marry the idea of information flow with the technical writer's strength of content development? This brings me to the next idea station in this essay: Content Experience.
