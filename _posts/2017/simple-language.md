simple language:


1. why do academics write in complex language?
sophisticated thoughts? lazy? they're in the business of sounding and being intellectual.

the more cmoplex ideas you have, them ore you should really simplify the language so that you can whittle down your complex ideas into more simple, straightforward sentences that you're sure you understand.

2. how do you measure simple language?
reading measures. sentence length, word length, sentence construction

3. why do people write in complex language?
b/c it's hard to clarify exactly what you mean. our thoughts are fuzzy. fuzzy thoughts == complex language.


4. do you write in complex language because your ideas are complex?
not necessarily. you write this way if you don't have a firm grasp on your point.

5. can you hide simple ideas behind complex language?
yes.

when you try to draw a picture, that's when you really force yourself to be clear about your point.

6. does it just take more effort to translate complex ideas into simple language?
certainly
7. how effective is the hemingway app?
i think it's pretty good

8. what does the hemingway app do?
identifies coimplexity that you can't see

9. do shorter aid comprehension? why more comprehensible over long ones?
just b/c sentences are longer, does that create more drain on processing power in your mind or something? don't you have to supply the connections between the shorter sentences? or can you process things better when treating them as smaller units?


10. why are adverbs problematic?

there are a lot of unnecessary words. they only slightly modify your core sentence. you might as well just say it more directly.

there's a lot to be said for using active tense as well.

most interesting thought: the negative effects?

The reason for this phenomenon, Oppenheimer explains, is that the ease of processing information is strongly associated with positive qualities such as confidence, intelligence, and capability. “To the extent that you use long words, you make it more disfluent to read your prose, people will judge you disfavorably,” says Oppenheimer.

there's not a strong argument against simple language. everyone seems to recommend it. benefits:

- easier comprehension, faster reading. users can skim/scan. meaning more clear. positive feelings from users. so why would someone choose to write in complex sentences? lazy? not aware of complex sentences. doesn't want to take the time to make it simpler. like that pope quote -- sorry for the long email, i didn't have time to make it shorter.


-----------

almost no one argues against simple language. it's probably like salad. no one argues against salad but no one eats it either. simple language is like salad. but there's also an awareness factor. we might make our content much simpler, different, if we could see people reading it, struggling against clarity, and so on.

the biggest motivator toward making language simple might simply be making users aware of their language. that's what the hemingway's app's value is. it helps you become aware of your language. we're been writing for so long with certain conventions, we're blind to the levels that we're writing at.

making someone aware of their actions is the first step. we're aware but not persuaded by the effects.


1. could awareness of the complexity of language prompt us to make it simpler?
yes, it could be an awareness issue.
2. should you push all your posts through the hemingway app?
might be a good idea. but i don't really like how things sound when they're short and choppy. they lack flow. there's a certain elegance and flow in prose that we like. it builds ethos in the reader's mind toward our credibility.
3. is there a fear in the back of your mind that writing in simple language will make your posts appear simplistic, your ideas and thoughts simpler and more basic than they really are?

yes, we reject it. we agree with simplicity but when we read our content, it seems perfectly straightfoward to us.


4. if you start seeing problems in prose everywhere, will it distract you, like seeing utilize everywhere instead of use?

yes, you'll start to wake up to the reality of how things are.


5. people are more concerned about having correct grammar than they are about readability. as evidenced by the popularity of grammarly at the expense of hemingway app. it's a face thing. illiterate grammar makes you look stupid. so the primary purpose seems to connect to the appearance of thought. people think that if you have followed the rules of grammar, that is enough.

What does the Hemingway app flag?

- long sentences
- unnecessary words
- use of the passive voice
- phrases that have simpler alternatives
- too many adverbs

purpose is to make your writing bold and clear, not just simpler and easier to understand.

“After spending our days writing, we realized a common mistake: sentences easily grow to the point that they became difficult to understand,” the Longs told me on Wednesday in an e-mail. “The worst part is we didn’t realize we were doing it. Our text was more clear and persuasive when we kept it simple.” Adam, who is twenty-five, works in marketing in North Carolina. His brother Ben, twenty-two, is a copywriter in New York. “While complaining about it on the phone, we decided there should be an easy way to help people realize when their writing was too dense,” they said. http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/hemingway-takes-the-hemingway-test

But do we want to write like Hemingway? Or, better, did Hemingway really write like Hemingway?

I'm not sure why the hemingway app has a certain turn off. does the plain language it encourages come off ugly to us?

for sure, we agree in theory with simplicity, but we disagree with the practice. there's stuff there that we disagree with. we disagree that our content isn't already simple. we disagree that... our sentences don't flow with a certain beauty and grace.

yes, i think we agree with an abstract theory but disagree with the implementation. we don't want to write in short choppy sentences. we think this makes us look dumb, simplistic. we like to add flair and style to our prose to reflect our learnedness. this is the language of the net. it's clear in the nytimes article that the person rejects the hemingway app. do we really want to write like this? no. there's a certain flow that you lose out on when you chop up your content. maybe we're not convinced that it really matters.

in larger scope, it's prob. more important to use subheadings, lists, to set off quotes, etc., than to use short sentences.

Sample sentence from the NYTimes:

> The legislation may also have long-term consequences for the American relationship with Russia and for the power of the presidency. Once sanctions are written into law, they are much harder to lift, even long after the circumstances prompting them have changed, which is one reason European allies opposed the bill. And presidents from both parties have long resisted Congress’s inserting itself into the process of determining foreign policy through mandatory sanctions.

> An activity is the entry point for interacting with the user. It represents a single screen with a user interface. For example, an email app might have one activity that shows a list of new emails, another activity to compose an email, and another activity for reading emails. Although the activities work together to form a cohesive user experience in the email app, each one is independent of the others. As such, a different app can start any one of these activities if the email app allows it. For example, a camera app can start the activity in the email app that composes new mail to allow the user to share a picture. An activity facilitates the following key interactions between system and app:

> Having a weekly standing meeting where you keep track of the progress along all the stages is important. This gives people a known place to go and discuss issues or ideas. It also provides a sense that the project is moving forward. At the beginning these meetings will be used to plan and track implementation. After implementation, it will be a place to drive adoption and gather feedback.

> Among the 471 participants randomized (body mass index [BMI], 25 to <40; age range, 18-35 years; 28.9% nonwhite, 77.2% women), 470 (233 in the standard intervention group, 237 in the enhanced intervention group) initiated the interventions as randomized, and 74.5% completed the study. For the enhanced intervention group, mean base line weight was 96.3 kg (95% CI, 94.2-98.5) and 24-month weight 92.8 kg (95% CI, 90.6- 95.0) [corrected]. For the standard intervention group, mean baseline weight was 95.2kg (95%CI,93.0-97.3)and24-month weight was 89.3 kg (95%CI, 87.1-91.5) [corrected]. Weight change at 24 months differed significantly by intervention group (estimated mean weight loss, 3.5 kg [95% CI, 2.6-4.5} in the enhanced intervention group and 5.9 kg [95% CI, 5.0-6.8] in the standard intervention group; difference, 2.4 kg [95% CI, 1.0-3.7]; P = .002). Both groups had significant improvements in body composition, fitness, physical activity, and diet, with no significant difference between groups.

> Here is another way of looking at physics: the physicists are men looking for new interpretations of the Book of Nature. After each pedestrian period of normal science, they dream up a new model, a new picture, a new vocabulary, and then they announce that the true meaning of the Book has been discovered. But, of course, it never is, any more than the true meaning of Coriolanus or the Dunciad or the Phenomenology of Spirit, or the Philosophical Investigations. What makes them physicists is that their writings are commentaries on the writings of earlier interpreters of Nature, not that they all are somehow "talking about the same thing," the invisibilia *Dei sive naturae* toward which their inquiries steadily converge.

> In the postwar economic boom, the technologies of flight that had been invented or advanced for the military were turned to civilian use as well as to the exploration of space. And the reality of the Cold War meant that while the military buildup may have slowed somewhat, it never truly stopped. The same was true of the information required to develop, support, use, and maintain the mate´ riel of both war and peace. The need for technical communicators only increased during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, as prop planes gave way to jet aircraft, wartime rockets were transformed into vehicles that carried humans into space, and even more terrible weapons were developed. Similarly, the relative prosperity of these years fueled a demand for consumer products that also required information to operate and repair them.
