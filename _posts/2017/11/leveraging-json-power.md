- what can you do with json that you can't do with xml? use js to pull it from a web location onto the page.
- flip side of previous question. render larger docs with it.
- is the main application integration into context sensitive help? yes. but also the linter with mdn.
- how useful are the markdownify and jsonify filters when working with content like this? cool.
- could you output xml into a json format? prob.
- why did xml stay with documents but get abandoned with apis? xml and js are diff. stacks. too heavy. not sure.
- is this the best way to do CSH? yes. this is what this topic is really about.
- what are some other ways to do CSH, esp. if you're using DITA or some other XML? snippets or some small file. dit has the idea of a conref.
- json isn't an authoring format, for sure. but yaml might be in some ways. xml is an authoring format. difference in modes?
- why are you drawn to json? its simplicity? ties more into apis, which almost all use json.
- the main appeal of json seems to be integration into the ui, right? where else might it come in handy? the scenario of dynamically updating that list of whitelisted domains? could you do that with xml? build a help api? what would that look like?
