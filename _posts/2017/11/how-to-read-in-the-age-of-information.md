## Why am I not a more immersive reader?

Last week I posted about the need to balance writing, editing, and learning. Doing too much of any one activity leads to burnout. Like a triathlete who switches from swimming to running or biking and finds renewed energy by exercising new muscles, the same renewal comes from switching between writing, editing, and learning.

Since that post, I've been reading more, or trying to read more. Sometimes reading gives me a sharpened mind and a heightened mental state, for sure. The problem is, I struggle to find the right reading material. I'm not quite sure what to read. When I do find something half-way relevant, I often lose interest. I'm confused why I'm not a more immersive reader.

I've never considered myself a "voracious reader." Because I'm a technical writer and blogger, with a BA in English and MFA in literary nonfiction writing, I feel like I should revel in reading, staying up late at night to immerse myself deep in interesting texts. But for some reason, I struggle with that.

## What I like to read

What exactly do I read? I divide my reading into two genres: fiction and non-fiction.

I often listen to fiction while I commute to work (or when I'm tired and doing dishes). My fiction tastes are low-brow, mostly consisting of the larger-than-life spy/CIA/military badass heroes (Jack Reacher, Mitch Rapp, Dewey Andreas, Evan Smoak, etc.) who get thrown into impossible scenarios and then succeed in rough-and-tumble ways. I like the kind of books reviewed on [The Real Book Spy](https://therealbookspy.com/).

But I listen to fiction as an escape, to be immersed in story. When I'm commuting, I only have partial attention to focus on material, so this genre fiction works well. But books aren't edifying or educational. It's about the same as watching a good movie or TV show.

However, when I sit down to read, I'm usually fully alert mentally, and I am eager to be more intellectually engaged, so I read non-fiction. It's with the nonfiction that I struggle to find good reading material.

Ideally, what I'd like is to read an author who asks the same questions I'm interested in. I want to see a mind thinking, but I don't want a stream of conscious or text that constantly changes directions. I want the narrator to take me down the mental path he or she is exploring.

I want to see someone actively thinking, wrestling with ideas in creative, playful ways. Not taking him or herself too seriously, but still writing earnestly, and acting on the ideas as a kind of trial. In short, a modern-day Montaigne essaying forth, chasing ideas and working through answers.

## Finding relevant topics

Although I've described the style I like, it's hard to find authors who ask the same questions I'm interested in, and who write like this. As I get older, I have little patience for topics that don't seem relevant.

When I was in college, I read a lot of literary essays and fell in love with the personal essay style that authors like Joseph Epstein and Philip Lopate mastered. But now, when I read literary nonfiction, I'm bored by the slow setup, the over-abundance of personal details, the arduous painting of a mostly uninteresting scene and eventual story. The ideas tend to be unexciting, memoir themes surface too frequently, and I find myself quickly looking for another genre.

Unsurprisingly, books that appealed to me in college don't appeal to me today. I've changed. I'm now a working professional and family provider, and I'm more cautious about the demands on my time. It could take hours or weeks to sit down and read a book from cover to cover. I often assess the ROI of any endeavor. I know I should read more classics. But will this content increase my skillset in some way, make me better at my job, make me smarter, more talented, or give me an advantage me in some other way? Will it at least satiate my curiosity in some way? If not, I might not have the time.

<!-- Technology has also distorted my reading habits. I skim online content so frequently, when I do actually have a book I want to read, my eyes are still moving in a scanning and skimming pattern, like I'm looking for keywords or relevance. I have to purposely slow down and read more at a slower pace, line by line. It's hard to switch modes. It's like my left-to-right eye motions become broken.

My attention span is also short. I rarely read more than a few chapters of a book. Book authors get into more details than I'm interested in absorbing. I don't need to pour through every detail concerning the author's methodology, nuanced arguments, and other tangents. Give me the high-level summary, the core ideas, and if I'm interested in more information, I'll drill down. -->

Relevance is usually established by a specific reader's interest in some hobby or subject. However, I don't have a particular hobby that I want to read about. I like watching sports, but I don't want to read sports books. I like cycling, but I'm not interested in cycling books. (In my opinion, exercise is for the body, not necessarily the mind.) I like to travel and see new places, but again, I'm not going to dive into travel books. I used to read historical-religious books, like biographies of St. Francis, books by Bart Ehrman, and so forth. But when I left religion, I lost interest in that chapter of my life.

As a technical writer, tech comm books are more relevant, but they typically fall into two categories: beginner or reference. Both put me to sleep. I thought philosophy might appeal to me, but all too often the higher-level, abstract questions they ask, such as how can we know reality, is there free will, what is the origin of knowledge, etc., don't always resonate with me.

At the end of the day, I prefer to read texts that explore questions I'm asking. What interests me changes from week to week (I guess I'm somewhat shallow like that), but when a topic swims around in my mind, I want to cast my reading net far and wide around it. As such, I want to draw from a whole library on the topic, since a book might only address a topic briefly. I want to search across the texts, and read a chapter on the same topic from different authors.

I'm fond of the Safari Books Online library, which has thousands of titles, mostly focusing on technology and business. The books seem to be most relevant to questions I tend to ask, and the library has a surprising number of tech comm books. I'm fortunate enough to have full access to the content.

Beyond closed libraries, the open Internet provides a sea of information. It's not hard to find short articles on questions I'm asking. From blog posts to online magazines, forum threads, and other sources, the information abounds but doesn't usually explore the topic at length in an immersive way.

Regardless of the topic, in general I don't think I'm systematic or structured enough in my reading. Too often I think I should read for reading's sake, without understanding the larger motivation behind *why* I'm reading. Reading for reading's sake alone tends to fall short.

## Others on reading

Let's briefly explore what others have said about reading. Novelist Lauren B. Davis explains,

> I let my curiosity lead me — astronomy today, prison reform tomorrow .. . biographies, psychology, theology, Scandinavian murder mysteries, South American magical realists, poetry, Celtic saints and Anglo-Saxon England . . . it just depends on what catches my attention. "

She says not to focus on reading "correctly" but rather to read what you love:

> No matter what you read, no matter where it leads you, read what you love, what feeds you, and keep on reading. ([If You Find Reading Boring, You’re Not Doing It Right.](http://laurenbdavis.com/2012/08/if-you-find-reading-boring-youre-not-doing-it-right/)))

Ronald D. Vale promotes the value of asking questions as a way to trigger genuine curiosity and exploration. He's talking about science education in schools, but I assume the same principles would apply across subjects.

> Pursued properly, a good question also can be an excellent vehicle with which to start a process of inquiry. Investigating an answer to a question need not require a laboratory, special equipment, or money. The goal of asking and answering a question is not necessarily to probe a completely untouched area of science (which is unrealistic for K–12). Rather, it should be a personal quest to resolve a curiosity and grapple with trying to understand the answer. Furthermore, researching one question often results in a further round of questions that dig deeper into a phenomenon.

## Why we read

To better understand why some people are not driven to read, let's take a step back and analyze why we read in the first place.

As I see it, an author begins with a question. For example, Homer begins the Odyssey by asking why the Trojans lost the war. This is the pretext for the story and details that follow. Almost every text starts out as an answer to some question. Some authors make this question explicit, while others begin with the answer directly, and you have to trace back what their original question might have been (almost like playing jeopardy).

Typically, in texts I like, the author leads into the content by establishing how the question became relevant for him or her, and why. As a reader, if you find the question interesting or relevant to your own life, then both author the reader are connected with the same quest (note the similar to "quest-ion").

After establishing the question, there's a purpose for the text, a road to follow. As a reader, if you find the question relevant, you decide to sit in the figurative passenger seat of the author/driver, because you have a common destination. You both want to get answers to the same question. If the driver is headed to Wyoming, but you want to go to New York, you'd never decide to get into the passenger seat. But if you want to see Wyoming too, then you're on board and engaged.

If the question is simple and the answer is equally simple, there's not much point. You don't need a text for this scenario. Many of our questions fall into this category, and the answers are commonly found in reference material. It's the difficult questions that don't have easy answers (which you can't simply google), that capture our attention.

Perhaps we seek this nugget of knowledge because it will either improve our lives or satisfy our curiosity. Perhaps we just love wisdom and want to tussle out the answer in our minds. A skilled author takes you along the journey to the answer, showing you the necessary roads traveled, the detours, the view points, and other scenery along the way. You don't want the author to drive aimlessly or circuitously, but you also don't expect a straight shot from A to B.

In the end, difficult questions rarely have clearcut answers, so the author usually finds some partial answer, a partial solution or piece of information that yields some satisfaction. The effort along the journey will have been worth the time.

## Active reading begins with active thinking

Active reading begins with active thinking. In other words, when you're actively thinking, you naturally start reading more because you're engaged with a particular topic that you want to learn more about. The more voracious of a thinker you are, the more likely you are to be a voracious reader.

What questions are you asking even before you seek out the text to read? What are you genuinely curious about? Curiosity is the first step to reading, because it gives a purpose to reading. You seek out texts because you're looking for answers or thoughts on a topic; you're not just reading for reading's sake. When you find an author who is asking a similar question, you connect and the rest of the content pulls you in.

Without this curiosity towards life, without actively asking questions yourself, reading will likely be a chore, disconnected from your regular life, or time spent in escape. If we lead passive lives, where we never ask questions that we care about, we'll be less likely to dig into texts for the answers.

Granted, there are plenty of bookworms who love learning for learning's sake, and are happy to drink widely and deeply from many different knowledge sources, like a passerby who stops at a college and sits in a random class, or a hobo who rides a figurative learning train for a while before getting off and on another one.

But my life doesn't seem to wave in that rhythm. I need something more to ground me. In my mind, the ideal life is one that is lived in more directed way. Like Thoreau's expression of living deliberately, when he asserts:

> I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.

Or like Pythagoras, the first philosopher, dwelling in a secret cave and living and devoting his life to inquiry.

## Reading to learn what you are unaware of

Undeniably, it's hard to sustain that kind of focus and even to find substantial sources to read along the same topic. For example, although you will find essays here and there on reading, there aren't many books entirely devoted to this topic. Doing "research" (rather than just reading) involves hunting and gathering information from a lot of different sources, authors, and channels. Much of it might be junk or unrelated. Research requires seeking and evaluating, not just reading page after page.

Additionally, although our own enquiries can help drive our desire to read and learn about the subject, we're still subject to the limitations of our ignorance. There are many things I'm completely unaware of, and by reading or listening to lectures, I often learn about questions I would have never thought to ask.

For example, right now I'm listening to The Great Ideas of Philosophy. I realize how little I know, how many others have asked and explored really interesting topics. Sometimes I feel that before I can even engage with some of my questions, I have to lay the foundation with some of these courses. In that regard, one wouldn't always need to drive reading with questions. Simply reading to learn what you don't know can be the quest.

## Time to be voracious

Perhaps the biggest challenge is how to find the time to read voraciously. If you work full-time, have a family and other obligations, you probably don't have hours upon hours to read voraciously. On the other hand, if you live alone and can sit uninterrupted on your couch with your cat, if you're a college professor with ample research time in the library, if you can abandon all society and go live in the woods by yourself, you might have time to spend half your day reading.

After I work all day and come home, I typically have 2-3 hours of free time, during which I usually decompress, interact with my family, watch some form of entertainment, and sometimes even clean. I'm not sure when I'm supposed to be reading voraciously.

And yet, I'm not ready to submit to a life of monotonous technical writing work in exchange for a life of inquiry. Is there a compromise one can make? Maybe.

Instead of seeing my professional work as a mere means of financial sustainment, what if I could examine the issues from a philosophical mindset? Can technical writing be philosophical? Can you do philosophy in the corporate workplace? Perhaps this just becomes insightful practitioner knowledge about your industry, not real philosophy or engagement on any level with the same overarching metaphysical, ontological, and epistemological categories of discourse in the classics.

And yet, I can't help but think that all thought, if examined deeply enough, might reach down into the same roots. The philosophical mind is a questioning mind, a curious mind, an experimenter and an trial engager. If one could incorporate such an effort in the workplace, it might convert the mundanity of corporate work into something on a higher plane.

But for the real style I want to read, I haven't found that genre yet. I keep looking. In some ways I try to write what I want to read.



- tech changed me
- the job changed me


-

- follow-up to post about balance. need to read, but what?
- problem: want to read more, from reading i gain a sharpened mind, heightened mental state.
 but i struggle with finding the right material.
  - lose interest quickly
  - feel like i become dsylexic from scanning so much
  - not sure whether kindle, physical book, online format
  - feel like fiction/lit. kind of a waste of time.
  - how can i rekindle my love of reading? as a writer, shoudln't i love to read? be a "voracious reader"

- what kind of writing do i like to read?
  - nonfiction
  - idea-rich, broken up, not longwinded, not telling me obvious things, sarcastic, funny, insightful, daring.
  - i like to read content that asks as a really interesting question, and then dives into the struggle to find an answer. essayists, i guess.
  - curiosity is what really ignites me. like to see the mind at work, thinking but not stream of conscious. like to see evidence of real thought. something that makes me see the world differently. malcolm gladwell with revisionist history?
  - if you're interested in a thinking mind, does the subject even matter? theoretically, it shouldn't. but this isn't often the case.
  - montaigne is dated
  - philosophy doesn't seem to ask the questions i'm interested in. such a chore to read.
  - tech comm books are mostly reference or beginner-oriented and therefore quite boring. hat tip to ellis pratt on his books podcast.

- trouble with books
  - most books i read, they seem padded with unnecessary details.  give me the high-level ideas in a nutshell and i'll dive in deeper if i want. but not really interested in spending weeks reading what i can get in an hour.
  - i want access to an entirely library b/c the kindle sample isn't often enough and i will likely grow tired of a book before i feel the expense was worth it
  - book/content must be relevant to my interests in some way. it's not enough for general interest content to become relevant. moves too slow, too many details that don't seem important.
  - do we outgrow literature? environment totally changes, working full time with family, obligations. have seen the world. i think we grow more cautious about demands on our time. has to be worth it in a more direct way. there's a hands-on nature with them and a more direct relevance where you find more value in them.
  - are my readnig habits flipped? what was boring as a teen is now interesting, and vice versa? yeah pretty much. this is weird. not sure what as relevant for me.
  - demands for relevance are higher, but did i demand relevance as a teen too? yeah, but maybe my demands were more story centered.

- where i settle
  - books in safari which is a more technical library seem to appeal most to me.








--------------------ß

- is it more worthwhile, in the long run, to spend time immersed in classics that withstand the test of time? well, not sure, but maybe mix the two?
- can i still find enjoyment from these more technical books? yes,



problem: want to read more, but feel like my approach doesn't quite fit
- lose interest quickly
- feel like i become dsylexic from scanning so much
- so many sources to look through. formats abound, not sure what suits me best.
- feel like fiction kind of a waste of time.

how can i rekindle my love of reading? as a writer, shoudln't i love to read?

- is it all the shitty writing that is everywhere? now that everyone is a writer, we find out that many people are allowed top ublish but cannot write. yeah, this is probably a huge part of it. so much shitty writing, our default mode is to skim and skip around so much. this kind of ruins our ability to consume content as we used to.
- what kind of writing do i like to read? idea-rich, broken up, not longwinded, not telling me obvious things, sarcastic, funny, insightful, daring.
- does it even matter what i read, so long as i read? i'm starting to think maybe not, but i made a mistake by prioritizing tech learning over the type of learning i actually enjoy. what type of nonfiction content do i actually enjoy?
- what neural pathways in the brain form as a result of reading? not sure, but something is clicking away there and forming.
- what do i gain from reading? sharpened mind, heightened mental state.
- what device is more suitable for reading? prob. computer or kindle fire. allows you to read more quickly.
- when was the last time i really enjoyed reading something? philip lopate? personal essays? i need to find this content again.
- do i write what i also like to read? why not? not always.
- what kind of formulas would work well for writing that would result in an engaging read as i like? keep it short. never more than 800 words. you know the formula. work up to a question, and then dig around for the answer.
-

i like to read content that asks as a really interesting question, and then dives into the struggle to find an answer.

identify questions that are at the heart of our banal existence in this world, and dive deeply into them.


other thoughts:
- some great writers weren't great readers. dickens, balzac. why?
- active, directed reading defined by the questions i'm interested in. varies considerably. hunt and peck from various places.
- at the age where i won't read stuff that doesn't interest me. we only read the classics because we're forced to.
- want the topic to be relevant to my interests more than just consuming the literary style and story. for relevant topics, i'm not sure i have strong interests. what am i interested in? writing, cycling, tennis, basketball, sports, physics, history, curiosity
- curiosity is what really ignites me. like to see the mind at work, thinking but not stream of conscious. like to see evidence of real insight, thought. something that makes me see the world differently. malcolm gladwell?
- nonfiction book topics: history, philosophy, religion, science, technology --> not really interested in any of these.
- how about books related to my career, tech comm or web design or something like that? it would prob. be a lot more relevant like this. relevance is the first criteria of a book.
- tech comm books are mostly reference or beginner-oriented and therefore quite boring.
- books in safari which is a more technical library seem to appeal most to me.
- i want access to an entirely library b/c the kindle sample isn't often enough and i will likely grow tired of a bok before i feel the expense was worth it

- do we outgrow literature? environment totally changes, working full time with family, obligations. have seen the world. i think we grow more cautious about demands on our time. has to be worth it in a more direct way.
- does literature lose its value proposition? kind of. turn more to reading as a form of escape b/c we get in this quadrant more.
- could it be that literature at one point of my life no longer has the same appeal or value at another? i think definitely. not as young and full of idealism as before.
- does creative writing not have the same idea engagement that i really want in order to be intellectually engaged? doesn't seem to. seems like a lot of slow story without more compelling engagement.
- am i not giving the classics the effort they deserve? prob not but they seem so dated.
- what happened to my love of story? is it a different kind of story? not sure. story is hard. kind of engaged by the superman character.
- is there value in reading even if it's not directly related to what you're writing? yes, same like with conferences.
- did extrinsic motivation drive your love of literature? i think i was more driven by some other means and motivations.
- do you need to have some interests in order for nonfiction to become relevant? i think so. it's not enough for general interest content to become relevant. moves too slow, too many details that don't seem important.
