- follow-up to post about balance. need to read, but what?
- problem: want to read more, from reading i gain a sharpened mind, heightened mental state.
 but i struggle with finding the right material.
  - lose interest quickly
  - feel like i become dsylexic from scanning so much
  - not sure whether kindle, physical book, online format
  - feel like fiction/lit. kind of a waste of time.
  - how can i rekindle my love of reading? as a writer, shoudln't i love to read? be a "voracious reader"

- what kind of writing do i like to read?
  - nonfiction
  - idea-rich, broken up, not longwinded, not telling me obvious things, sarcastic, funny, insightful, daring.
  - i like to read content that asks as a really interesting question, and then dives into the struggle to find an answer. essayists, i guess.
  - curiosity is what really ignites me. like to see the mind at work, thinking but not stream of conscious. like to see evidence of real thought. something that makes me see the world differently. malcolm gladwell with revisionist history?
  - if you're interested in a thinking mind, does the subject even matter? theoretically, it shouldn't. but this isn't often the case.
  - montaigne is dated
  - philosophy doesn't seem to ask the questions i'm interested in. such a chore to read.
  - tech comm books are mostly reference or beginner-oriented and therefore quite boring. hat tip to ellis pratt on his books podcast.

- trouble with books
  - most books i read, they seem padded with unnecessary details.  give me the high-level ideas in a nutshell and i'll dive in deeper if i want. but not really interested in spending weeks reading what i can get in an hour.
  - i want access to an entirely library b/c the kindle sample isn't often enough and i will likely grow tired of a book before i feel the expense was worth it
  - book/content must be relevant to my interests in some way. it's not enough for general interest content to become relevant. moves too slow, too many details that don't seem important.
  - do we outgrow literature? environment totally changes, working full time with family, obligations. have seen the world. i think we grow more cautious about demands on our time. has to be worth it in a more direct way. there's a hands-on nature with them and a more direct relevance where you find more value in them.
  - are my readnig habits flipped? what was boring as a teen is now interesting, and vice versa? yeah pretty much. this is weird. not sure what as relevant for me.
  - demands for relevance are higher, but did i demand relevance as a teen too? yeah, but maybe my demands were more story centered.

- where i settle
  - books in safari which is a more technical library seem to appeal most to me.








--------------------ÃŸ

- is it more worthwhile, in the long run, to spend time immersed in classics that withstand the test of time? well, not sure, but maybe mix the two?
- can i still find enjoyment from these more technical books? yes,



problem: want to read more, but feel like my approach doesn't quite fit
- lose interest quickly
- feel like i become dsylexic from scanning so much
- so many sources to look through. formats abound, not sure what suits me best.
- feel like fiction kind of a waste of time.

how can i rekindle my love of reading? as a writer, shoudln't i love to read?

- is it all the shitty writing that is everywhere? now that everyone is a writer, we find out that many people are allowed top ublish but cannot write. yeah, this is probably a huge part of it. so much shitty writing, our default mode is to skim and skip around so much. this kind of ruins our ability to consume content as we used to.
- what kind of writing do i like to read? idea-rich, broken up, not longwinded, not telling me obvious things, sarcastic, funny, insightful, daring.
- does it even matter what i read, so long as i read? i'm starting to think maybe not, but i made a mistake by prioritizing tech learning over the type of learning i actually enjoy. what type of nonfiction content do i actually enjoy?
- what neural pathways in the brain form as a result of reading? not sure, but something is clicking away there and forming.
- what do i gain from reading? sharpened mind, heightened mental state.
- what device is more suitable for reading? prob. computer or kindle fire. allows you to read more quickly.
- when was the last time i really enjoyed reading something? philip lopate? personal essays? i need to find this content again.
- do i write what i also like to read? why not? not always.
- what kind of formulas would work well for writing that would result in an engaging read as i like? keep it short. never more than 800 words. you know the formula. work up to a question, and then dig around for the answer.
-

i like to read content that asks as a really interesting question, and then dives into the struggle to find an answer.

identify questions that are at the heart of our banal existence in this world, and dive deeply into them.


other thoughts:
- some great writers weren't great readers. dickens, balzac. why?
- active, directed reading defined by the questions i'm interested in. varies considerably. hunt and peck from various places.
- at the age where i won't read stuff that doesn't interest me. we only read the classics because we're forced to.
- want the topic to be relevant to my interests more than just consuming the literary style and story. for relevant topics, i'm not sure i have strong interests. what am i interested in? writing, cycling, tennis, basketball, sports, physics, history, curiosity
- curiosity is what really ignites me. like to see the mind at work, thinking but not stream of conscious. like to see evidence of real insight, thought. something that makes me see the world differently. malcolm gladwell?
- nonfiction book topics: history, philosophy, religion, science, technology --> not really interested in any of these.
- how about books related to my career, tech comm or web design or something like that? it would prob. be a lot more relevant like this. relevance is the first criteria of a book.
- tech comm books are mostly reference or beginner-oriented and therefore quite boring.
- books in safari which is a more technical library seem to appeal most to me.
- i want access to an entirely library b/c the kindle sample isn't often enough and i will likely grow tired of a bok before i feel the expense was worth it

- if you're interested in a thinking mind, does the subject even matter? theoretically, it shouldn't. but this isn't often the case.
- do we outgrow literature? environment totally changes, working full time with family, obligations. have seen the world. i think we grow more cautious about demands on our time. has to be worth it in a more direct way.
- does literature lose its value proposition? kind of. turn more to reading as a form of escape b/c we get in this quadrant more.
- could it be that literature at one point of my life no longer has the same appeal or value at another? i think definitely. not as young and full of idealism as before.
- does creative writing not have the same idea engagement that i really want in order to be intellectually engaged? doesn't seem to. seems like a lot of slow story without more compelling engagement.
- am i not giving the classics the effort they deserve? prob not but they seem so dated.
- what happened to my love of story? is it a different kind of story? not sure. story is hard. kind of engaged by the superman character.
- is there value in reading even if it's not directly related to what you're writing? yes, same like with conferences.
- did extrinsic motivation drive your love of literature? i think i was more driven by some other means and motivations.
- do you need to have some interests in order for nonfiction to become relevant? i think so. it's not enough for general interest content to become relevant. moves too slow, too many details that don't seem important.

- will the content in that library be just as dated as ancient greeks feel to me? prob. even more so. yes, but it is tech and quite interesting.
- am i too caught up in business and tech? after i retire, won't all of that become meaningless and irrelevant? when you retire, you will be half android.
- is it more worthwhile, in the long run, to spend time immersed in classics that withstand the test of time? well, not sure, but maybe mix the two?
- why doesn't philosophy appeal to you? the questions they're looking to answer aren't my same questions.
- can i still find enjoyment from these more technical books? yes, there's a hands-on nature with them and a more direct relevance where you find more value in them.
- what is it that i find more engaging about the tech content? is it more hands-on? i do like being able to use the knowledge. there's an roi on the activity.
