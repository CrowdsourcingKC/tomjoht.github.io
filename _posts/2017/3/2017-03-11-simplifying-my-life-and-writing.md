summary: "For a while now I've wanted to simplify my life. When I tell this to people, almost everyone can relate. But the move toward simplicity isn't just about removing business. Simplicity lets you focus on the things you actually want to do, rather than those things you feel obligated to do but have no desire to do. I have a goal to simplify my writing style as well, using tools such as the Hemingway app."

In [Zen Habits][zen], the short list on how to simplify your life involves just two steps:

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Identify whatâ€™s most important to you.</li>
<li>Eliminate everything else.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

I realized that although outside commitments look small, they start to build up. Pretty soon I find myself spending more time than I want involved in these activities, in meetings with people (that I'm not especially fond of) when I'd rather be at home with my family or simply doing other things, like writing, or coding.

In identifying what's important me, I decided to reduce my commitments as much as possible. I started by removing external commitments:

* said no to invitations to present at STC chapters
* said no to invitations to give webinars
* eliminated any participation in conferences that my work doesn't pay for
* transitioned my program management, webmaster, and media recording/publishing roles in the STC Silicon Valley chapter to other people
* stepped down from my co-organizer role in the Write the Docs SF meetup group
* removed the contact information from my blog

My efforts toward simplification don't mean reducing my writing/blogging activities. Writing is one of the activities I enjoy. In fact, *I want to do more writing*. I especially want to start writing e-books for Kindle.

I also want to simplify my writing. In editing my wife's academic essays, I've realized how wordy and unnecessarily complicated writing often gets. I've started pushing all my writing through the [Hemingway app][hemingway] to look for ways to simplify it. I try to follow the ASD-STE100 guidelines of communicating just one idea per sentence. It's much, much hard to make content simple and readable than it is to do brain dumps in long, complex sentences (strung together by endless commas, dashes, and other punctuation).

I also started using kanban workflows more diligently at work and at home. Kanban reduces the number of items in progress and lets you focus with more sanity and less scatter-brainedness.

In other simplification efforts, I "archived" a bunch of clothes I never wear. I continue to ride my bike to work (reducing the need for my own car). My kids aren't involved in a million extra-curricular activities but actually have time to be kids.

I play basketball several times a week because it's another activity I enjoy. But I turned down invites to play in a two different rec leagues. I don't like commitments that pin me to specific events. I'm more than happy to play pick-up ball when I want.

You may see me focus less on tools in upcoming posts. I love Jekyll, but at my work I've realized that our best web publishing strategy is simply to deliver plain HTML to the web publishing team and let them stuff it into templates and move it through publishing pipeline. I want to focus on content, not tools.

That's about it.
