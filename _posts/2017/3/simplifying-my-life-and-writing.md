In [Zen Habits][zen], the short list on how to simplify your life involves just two steps:

> 	1.	Identify whatâ€™s most important to you.
> 	2.	Eliminate everything else.

I realized that although outside commitments look small, they start to build up. Pretty soon I find myself spending more time than I want involved in these activities, in meetings with people (that I'm not especially fond of) when I'd rather be at home with my family.

In identifying what's important me, I decided to reduce my commitments as much as possible. I started by reducing my commitments as much as possible:

* Saying no to invitations to present at STC chapters
* Saying no to invitations to give webinars
* Eliminating any participation in conferences that my work doesn't pay for
* Transitioning my program management, webmaster, and media recording/publishing roles in the STC Silicon Valley chapter to other people
* Stepping down from my co-organizer roleIn the Write the Docs SF meetup group
* Removing the contact information from my blog

Note: My efforts toward simplification don't mean reducing my writing/blogging activities. Writing is one of the activities I enjoy. In fact, I want to do more writing. Rather than flagellate myself with more and more tech learning in my spare time, I want to spend more time writing creative essays. I'd even like to mix in some essays that step outside of tech writing.

Additionally, I plan on reducing my contributions to the Jekyll docs and transitioning the tool support at my work to our web publishing team. I want to focus on content, not tools.

I also started using kanban workflows more diligently at work. Kanban reduces the number of items in progress and lets you focus with more sanity and less scatter-brainedness.

I also want to simplify my writing. In editing my wife's academic essays, I've realized how wordy and unnecessarily complicated writing often gets. I've started pushing all my writing through the Hemingway app to look for ways to simplify it. I try to follow the ASD-STE100 guidelines of communicating just one idea per sentence. It's much, much hard to make content simple and readable than it is to do a brain dump in long, complex sentences strung together by as much punctuation as you can leverage.

In other simplification efforts, I "archived" a bunch of clothes I never wear. I continue to ride my bike to work (reducing the need for my own car).

I play basketball several times a week because it's another activity I enjoy. But I turned down invites to play in a two different rec leagues. I don't like commitments that pin me to specific events. I'm more than happy to play pick-up ball when I want.

That's about it. I'm pretty sure I won't ever volunteer or join anything for a long time.
