In [Enough to Be Dangerous: The Joy of Bad Python](http://hackwrite.com/posts/enough-to-be-dangerous/), Adam Wood argues that tech writers don't need to be expert coders, on par with developers. Learning to code badly is often enough to perform the tasks needed for documentation.

Adam writes:

> You already know how hard it is to go from zero (or even 1) to actually-qualified developer. And you've met too many not-actually-qualified developers to have any interest in that path.
> So how do you get started?
> By deciding you are not ever going to write any application code. You are not going to be a developer. You are not even going to be a "coder."
> You are going to be a technical writer with bad coding skills. ([Enough to Be Dangerous: The Joy of Bad Python](http://hackwrite.com/posts/enough-to-be-dangerous/))

Adam says tech writers who are learning to code often underestimate the degree of difficulty in learning code. To reach developer proficiency with production-ready code, tech writers will need to sink much more time than they feasibly can. As such, tech writers shouldn't aspire to the same level as a developer. Instead, they should be content to develop minimal coding ability, or "enough to be dangerous".

James Rhea, in response to my post on [Generalist versus Specialist](http://idratherbewriting.com/2016/12/20/changing-roles-of-technical-writers/), also says that "adequate" technical knowledge is usually enough to get the job done, and that acquiring deeper technical knowledge has somewhat diminishing returns, since it means other aspects of documentation will likely be neglected. Rhea says,

> I wouldn’t aim for deep technical knowledge. I would aim for adequate technical knowledge, recognizing that what constitutes adequacy may vary by project, and that technical knowledge ought to grow over time due to immersion in the documentation and exposure to the technology and the industry.

> I speculate that the need for writers to have deep technical knowledge diminishes as Tech Comm teams grow in size and as other skills become more important than they are for smaller Tech Comm teams. I’m not claiming that deep technical knowledge is useless. I’m suggesting that (to frame it negatively) neglecting deep technical knowledge has less severe consequences than neglecting content curation, doc tool set, or workflow considerations.

Both Wood and Rhea agree that while learning to code is important, gaining deep technical knowledge isn't necessary. In contrast to Wood and Rhea, [James Neiman](http://drjamesneiman.com/), an experienced API technical writer, says that tech writers need an engineering background, such as a computer science degree, to excel in API documentation roles. He says tech writers often need to look over a developer's shoulder, watch them to code, or listen to a brief 15-minute explanation, in order to gather the knowledge needed. Neiman says you may need to take the code examples in Java and produce equivalent samples in another language, such as C++, all on your own.

James Neiman and [Andrew Davis](http://www.synergistech.com/) gave a presentation titled [Finding the right API Technical Writer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/lmNHBg20ql0) at a API conference in London last October.  Watch this excerpt at around the 23 minute mark:

It seems that Neiman argues for a higher level of coding proficiency than Wood or Rhea. The level of coding knowledge require no doubt depends on the position, environment, and expectations. If you're in a situation where the code is over your head, developers may send you chunks of code to add to the documentation. Without the technical acumen to fully undestand, test, and integrate the code in meaningful ways, you will be at the mercy of engineers and their terse explanations or cryptic inline comments.

Neiman says in one company, he tested out the code from engineers and found that much of it relied on programs, utilities, or other configurations already set up on the developers' computers. As such, they were blind to the initial setup requirements that users would need to properly run the code. This is an example of one danger of simply copying and pasting the code from engineers into documentation. While it may work on the developer's machine, it will fail for users.

The more technical you are, the more powerful of a role you can play in shaping the information. Neiman is a former engineer and says that during his career, he has probably worked with 20-25 different programming languages. Being able to learn a new language quickly and get up to speed is a key characteristic of his tech comm consulting success.

Given the difficulty of learning programming, this challenge constitutes probably the most strenuous aspect of API technical writing. How much programming do you need to know? How much time do you spend learning to code? How much priority should you spend on this task?

For example, do you dedicate 2 hours a day to simply learning to code in the particular language of the product you're documenting? Should you carve this time out of your employer's time, or your own? What strategies should you implement to learn code? What if what you're learning has little connection or relevance with the code you're documenting?

There are a lot of questions to answer about just how to learn code. But a few conclusions are clear:

*  Developer documentation requires some familiarity with code.
*  You have to understand explanations from engineers, including the terms used.
*  You should be able to test code from engineers.
*  Learning code will require a constant effort.
*  Learning to code badly may be enough to create good documentation.

Unfortunately, technical writers will likely be generalists with the code, not really good at developing themselves but knowing enough to get by. There's a certain sadness with this level of proficiency. If you want to excel in your career, usually this means mastering something in a thorough way. In the end, technical writers aren't trying to master code. They're trying to master documentation.
