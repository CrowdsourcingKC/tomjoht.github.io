summary: "Although traditionally as a technical writer you don't run into too many ethical scenarios for docs, sometimes you have situations where your ability to be transparent about a system's limitations gets curtailed by marketing or product management. Although it can be frustrating to have your documentation filtered like this, you can take comfort knowing that, given the decentralized nature of information on the web, where users can post information in forums, blogs, or other sites, the information filtered out of your docs will eventually be published online, though most likely not by you."

## Sample scenario with documentation and transparency

Here's a sample scenario where transparency gets complicated in docs. Let's say you're working on documentation for Project X. There are certain features of Project X that are currently missing (but might be forthcoming in the future &mdash; who knows). The missing features are surely ones that users will ask about, but the project manager doesn't want you (as a tech writer) to include the information about these missing features for fear that the documentation will generate negativity among the users.

Other times, the features within a software system may have weaknesses or other issues that would only become apparent later. As a technical writer who documented the system, you may have intimate knowledge that would potential turn users off. You know the weak spots and other problem areas in your app. Do you let users know too? This scenario has surfaced a few times in my career, and it's always difficult for me.

I feel pretty strongly about the need for transparency in documentation, especially when describing the limits or shortcomings of a system that users will want to know about. I didn't realize how strongly I felt about this until I had a recent project where this issue came up. During the project, I had some days where I could hardly concentrate on my audio books during my 8-mile rides to and from work. I would feel my tension getting worked up at night just thinking about it.

Then I wondered, more introspectively, why was I getting so worked up over this? Why did this matter so much to me? Whether I included all the information users wanted or not ... who the heck really cares? It's not, after all, my own product that I'm selling. I just work for a company that employs me to write, and this is the message they want to communicate. So I obliged, but not without a bit of resistance.

The experience made me think about my own values and why this issue of transparency might have been more close to home than it is for others. Was it my previous time in marketing? A history with religion? My values as a blogger? Something else?

## When I worked in Marketing

Earlier in my career, before turning to technical writing, I actually worked as a marketing copywriter. Being a marketing copywriter for a new product that you think everyone should own might be a fun job. But I was a copywriter for an alternative health and nutrition company, so I spent a lot of time and energy coming up with creative ways to write about protein pills and treatments like chelation, detoxification, and hyperbaric chambers. (Pretty much snake oil.)

The core product was protein pills. (News flash: you get enough protein in your daily diet (especially meat-eating Americans, without the need for supplements.) You don't need to add more protein into your body unless you're a triathlete who is half way through a body-emptying race and your muscles are so depleted they're literally eating themselves.

Despite the fact that I never used the company's products myself (in fact, the company was either too cheap to give me free samples, or they feared that if I tried the products and found they did nothing, I'd lose motivation to write rock-star sizzling copy that resulted in sales &mdash; ka-ching ka-ching!).

But I didn't care about the ethics behind writing marketing copy for snake oil. I would have been just as happy to spend my time writing copy for premium slug salt or re-usable pop cans or neon koozies &mdash; this didn't bother me one bit. As a budding marketing copywriter, I  didn't care because *I was writing*! I had left teaching behind me (sorry students, I never liked grading your !&*&*%#^@% essays). I was a full-fledged *writer* now and I was cracking away at articles.

I might have continued as a marketing copywriter if the pay were decent, but the pay sucked. In 2004, my entry-level copywriter job paid $33,000/year. That was unsustainable. I ended up turning to tech writing to survive.

In the end, I didn't leave marketing copywriting out of a penchant for honest and truthful information. I know we like to refer to Marketing as "the dark side," because it's full of shiny, fluffy copy that lacks substance, promises everything, and constantly re-assures readers that the product is "easy to use ... very simple and easy, easy, easy!" No, I was happy to stretch the truth. In fact, I took it as a challenge. The more useless/ridiculous the product, the more fun it was to write copy for it.

So if Marketing copy and its lies doesn't bug me, why did Project X, which seemed to veer from technical information into Marketing's dark side, unsettle me so?

## When I was in a controlling religious institution

It could be that my 20 years inside a controlling religious institution (some ex-mormons would call it a *cult*) contributed to my distaste for information distortion. As a teenager, I became best friends with a Mormon kid and ended up joining the Mormon church. (This was before the Internet, when information about Mormonism wasn't readily available.)

I spent many years going through the traditional Mormon channels (from BYU to mission to temple marriage to leadership callings) before finally waking up and realizing that I was in a controlling religious institution that was sanitizing, whitewashing, distorting, and hiding its history.

My awakening didn't happen overnight. I had a long trajectory of dissatisfaction with many years of empty curriculums about information that wasn't included when it should have been (like biographies of Joseph Smith in Sunday School manuals that casually portrayed him as monogamous). It wasn't until my wife woke me up to the rampant sexism and patriarchy that we decided to finally disassociate ourselves (and more importantly, our 4 young impressionable daughters) from the faith (and all faith, actually).

From that experience (which consumed a good chunk of my life), I have a deep skepticism toward institutions &mdash; not just religious institutions, but any controlling institution that tries to steer people to believe sanitized, filtered information. I think a lot of things are a scam now. Even my local optometrist and those darn 2-year prescription renewals they require before you can re-order contacts seem like a scam to me. I'm more guarded than I should be, probably.

When I turned to technical writing, I found it to be a natural fit and home for my open and honest values. Where else can you write plain, accurate, truthful information that users will find helpful? If we can't do this, then aren't we participating in the institutional lie?

## Blogging and transparency

I'm also a blogger who values transparency. Transparency is what earns your trust with readers. Back in 2009, I wrote a series of posts about the "7 Deadly Sins of Blogging." I said sin #1 was [Being fake](http://idratherbewriting.com/2009/09/15/seven-deadly-sins-of-blogging-1-being-fake/). In the post, I quote a pro blogger who explains that truth is the blogger's currency. Tony Hung explains:

> At the end of the day, trust is the only real currency in the blogosphere, and people who read blogs have the expectation that they're getting at the truth â€” in whatever form the truth is to them. And because there is the presumption of truth, readers will often react in an intense fashion to being manipulated, hoodwinked, and otherwise bamboozled. [The Rules Behind Creating a Great Blog](https://problogger.com/the-rules-behind-creating-a-great-blog/)

Transparency was as important at the beginning of blogging as it is today. The lack of transparency is why corporate blogs never took off and never will. Corporate blogs are little more than a variant of the press release.

I'm not quite sure why Marketing (and by association, Product Management) doesn't get the importance of transparency. On the Internet, you can't withhold or control information precisely because we no longer live in a decentralized information model. There isn't someone at the top who is controlling and deciding which information reaches the peons at the bottom.

If information is lacking in the official docs, Joe Blogger will post the information on his site, and now it will appear in google searches when people look for the information. Worse, when you don't provide the information on your own site, you relinquish control of the narrative. You let Joe Blogger tell the story of this highly sensitive topic you chose to omit from your documentation.

If Joe Blogger doesn't write about it, Frank Forum-Goer will ask about it in the forums. Then your support team will provide the information. Frank will reply with clarifying questions, and you'll have a nice long thread full of raw/heated user emotions underling the highly sensitive topic.

You can't hide information or control the narrative by omitting it. That's why we love the Internet &mdash; it is omniscience personified at our fingertips. If the Internet lacks the information, we add to it.

I know I'm preaching to the choir with this message. Almost no tech writer would champion information control and manipulation. But no doubt you've had a similar tough scenario as I have, where the plain-speaking words in your information-rich, helpful documentation were lassoed and hogtied by a product manager or marketer who didn't want anything negative included in the product's documentation.

How do you persuade these higher powers (who usually hold more clout and control) about the right strategies? Maybe we don't have to. When the information does start to unfold online, through blog posts, forums, and other information channels, perhaps a greater truth will be made plain. Those unencumbered by corporate muzzles will be able to explain the product shortcomings and limitations with absolute cutting clarity for the rest of the world to understand and benefit from.  

At the end of the day, we don't need to get upset whether we include or exclude information from the documentation. It will eventually be written, just not always by us.
