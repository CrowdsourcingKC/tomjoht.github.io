summary: "In addition to being a technical writer, I also play basketball. I might spend more time playing basketball, in fact, than I do writing on this blog. I never played college ball, but I love playing pickup basketball several times a week at various courts. Now that NBA finals just wrapped up, I figure it may be relevant to expound a bit on my pet theory about how to win at pickup basketball games, and how that same strategy might apply to winning at documentation."

Here's what wins pickup basketball games: **rebounds**. Why? When you dominate the boards with rebounds, you end up getting second-chance points. When you snatch a rebound, particularly an offensive rebound, you get another shot attempt. Typically teams shoot with around 25% accuracy (meaning they make 1 of 4 shot attempts). If you get twice as many offensive rebounds, you get twice as many shot attempts. The end result is that you're essentially shooting 50% instead of 25%. A team that shoots 25% cannot beat a team that shoots 50%.

If you look at the NBA Stat Summary on games, you'll see that the team that gets more rebounds usually wins. I monitored this casually at least 50 times during the recent NBA season, and about 80% of the time, the team that won had with rebounds.

Where the strategy breaks down is when teams have more accurate shooters &mdash; case in point, if you have Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson shooting, they're accurate with so many shots, rebounds become less important. But I'm talking about pickup basketball, not NBA superstar teams.

In pickup basketball, rebounds are even more influential because so few pickup ballers even bother to rebound. Most players take a shot and then retreat back down court. As a result, if you focus in a determined way to get the rebound, it makes a *huge* difference in your team's ability to win.

In technical writing, how do you increase your second and third-chance points? Very easy -- the doc may not be awesome on the first try (you could be missing steps, or maybe you veered off course a few times, or maybe you missed the end user's goal entirely). But you take the feedback you get from the user or reviewer and you iterate with a new version. That new version is like getting a rebound and making a second-shot attempt.

My favorite possessions in basketball games are when my team misses the shot 5 or more times, but we keep getting the rebound and getting another shot attempt. Eventually the shot goes in.

Each time we do a doc review with someone, even if the person isn't a real user but is a team member or other employee, the feedback we get can make our docs stronger and stronger. Eventually we get to the point that on that sixth or seventh iteration, our documentation is right on target -- a swoosh. The more we do that across each page of our documentation, the more points we figuratively accrue to the point that users feel that our doc succeeds.
