<p>In this videocast, I talk with <a title="Whitney Hess" href="http://whitneyhess.com">Whitney Hess</a> at the STC Summit in Dallas about her perspective on old guard versus new guard mentality, or in other words, the traditional offline, change-resistant mentality versus the web-savvy, social-media-saturated mindset more common with the younger generation. Whitney Hess is a user experience design consultant from New York City who was invited to speak at the Summit this year.</p>
