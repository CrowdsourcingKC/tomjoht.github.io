<p>How does the South by <a title="South by Southwest Interactive" href="http://sxsw.com/interactive">Southwest Interactive conference (SXSW)</a> compare with the <a title="STC Summit" href="http://conference.stc.org">STC Summit</a>? Are technical communicators behind the times when it comes to web trends and interactive media? I asked <a title="Anne Gentle" href="http://justwriteclick.com">Anne Gentle</a> and <a title="Janet Swisher" href="http://janetswisher.com">Janet Swisher</a>, two Austin locals who have attended SXSW, to compare SXSW with the STC Summit. We recorded this video at the STC Summit in Dallas.</p>
