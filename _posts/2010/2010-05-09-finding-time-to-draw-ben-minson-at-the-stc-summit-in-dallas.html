<p><a title="Ben Minson's blog, gryphonmountain.net" href="http://gryphonmountain.net">Ben Minson</a> and I attended <a title="More information about Don Moyer" href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/fellow-don-moyer">Don Moyer</a>'s session on drawing for technical communicators. Don explained simple drawing techniques to illustrate concepts. I asked Ben Minson, an artist, to comment on Don's session and evaluate whether he thinks the techniques would be useful or practical in the workplace.</p>
