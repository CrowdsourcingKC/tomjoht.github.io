<p>Avoid Over-Communication: Even if text isn't redundant, it can simply   be too wordy in an effort to explain every detail. Too much text   discourages reading—the eye tends to skip right over it—ironically   resulting in less communication rather than more. In UI text, concisely   communicate the essential information. If more information is necessary   for some users or some scenarios, provide a link to more detailed <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511449.aspx">Help content</a>, or perhaps to a glossary entry for clarification of a term.</p>
<p>equally important is not just text, but hierarchy, color, weight,   relationships, positioning, size -- all of these design aspects speak to   the meaning of the word as much as the words.  so it's not as if the   design is meaningless to communicate concepts, right? if you as a writer   are just sticking to text, then you are somewhat crippled, because  your  text can be overridden by the design aspects around the contnet  that  communicate meaning as well.</p>
<p>Before outlining 10 best practices for interface text, I have a few notes:</p>
<p>Many style guides describe rules for interface text style, such as  requiring colons before control labels, using a specific typography  (Apple uses 13px Lucida Grande), whether to use title or sentence case,  and so on. I have chosen to focus on matters other than style.</p>
<p>Unlike text in a help file that you control, you lose control and  autonomy over interface text. First, you are at the mercy of the  designers and developers to actually implement your recommendations.  Second, once implemented, you are at their mercy to make changes.  Because of this, controlling and maintaining interface text can be  frustrating, even if supposedly you "own" the text. (See <a href="http://www.stc.org/ConfProceed/1998/PDFs/00125.pdf">The Narrative User Interface</a>, by Nancy Raiken, Diane Stielstra, Richard Bloch.)</p>
<p>Other people refer to interface text as narrative text, instructional  text, screen text, user assistance text, and other names. I decided to  call it interface text because I want to blend together all text used in  the interface -- from the user's perspective, it isn't separate.</p>
<p>10 Best Practices for Interface Text</p>
<p>* we learn by doing, so it makes sense to place instruction net to action</p>
<p>* sometimes called narrative text, instructional text</p>
<p>* no distinction between supporting text and buttons, etc.</p>
<p>* not really focusing on a style guide, colons after control labels,  title or sentence case, not even typography, 13 lucida grande</p>
<p>* you lose control. <a href="http://www.stc.org/ConfProceed/1998/PDFs/00125.pdf">The Narrative User Interface</a>,  by Nancy Raiken, Diane Stielstra, Richard Bloch.In addition, to  integrate Help into the interface, writers and editors need to work  directly within the resource files (code). Issues of ownership, review  cycles, and change requests become more complicated. We not only have<br />
the possibility of daily changes, but we risk a loss of control over our traditional product.</p>
<p>1. love word meaning.</p>

<p>1. put next to the action (hughes)</p>

<p>"User assistance occurs within an action context—the user doing  something with an application—and should appear in close proximity to  the focus of that action—that is, the application it supports. The  optimal placement of user assistance, space permitting, is in the user  interface itself."</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the appropriate instructions in close proximity to their respective action objects.</li>
<li>Place the instructional text next to the corresponding action  object—preferably, in the downstream direction, to the right or just  below it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users skip static elements, such as instructional text, because they  focus immediately on downstream actionable objects. Effective user  assistance design accommodates users’ natural workflows by providing  instruction immediately beside or following interactive elements that  constitute points of need for more information.</p>
<p>Within a window, different UI elements receive different levels of  attention. Users tend to read control labels first, especially those  that appear relevant to completing the task at hand. By contrast, users  tend to read static text only when they think they need to. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa974176.aspx">User Interface Text: MSDN Library</a></p>
<p>2. keep in mind first-time use versus frequent use.</p>
<p>3. no tips in forms (jarrett). <a href="http://uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/03/dont-put-hints-inside-text-boxes-in-web-forms.php">Don't Put Hints Inside Text Boxes in Web Forms</a>, by Caroline Jarrett. They'll assume the form is already complete and keep going.</p>
<p>4. go with convention. e.g., front.</p>
<p>I am in my third year of graduate school, and I have fallen in love. I  have fallen for pronouns. It’s hard to shut me up about them</p>
<p>6. error messages should explain fix, jarrett. error msgs are tricky  because you often can't see them. you don't even know they exist.</p>
<p>7. context sensitive help should be array of questions, putkey. solves problem of forest and trees.</p>
<p>Users go to Help for only two reasons: They are confused about something on the current screen, or they need to<br />
find out how to accomplish a specific task. The narrative UI solves the first problem, but do we still need a Help<br />
system for the second one? Or would a better way of searching the interface solve the problem?</p>
<p>8. focus on pain points, hughes</p>
<p>9. design for skimming, microsoft</p>
<p>10. be brief. provide links for more information.</p>

<p>you must believe that you belong, truly.</p>
<p>putting help inside interface makes sense because you learn bydoing. .this puts the action together with the learning material.</p>
<p>you won't lose the manual</p>
<p>hughes says that when pople leave theapp interface, they feel like they're not getting their task done.</p>
<p>text in the interface is an art. lots to to consider:</p>
<p>what blake says, okay with text, but picky about how it's inserted, must be brief</p>
<p>hughes says to put the text near the action, otherwise it's ignored</p>
<p>questions more likely to get clicked than statements</p>
<p>users my only need thetext the first time, not on subsequent times</p>

<p>Software developers often think of text as relegated to product  documentation and technical support. "First we'll write the code, and  then we'll hire someone to help us explain what we have developed." Yet  in reality, important text is written earlier in the process, as the UI  is conceived and coded. This text is, after all, seen more frequently  and by more people than perhaps any other type of technical writing.</p>
<p>Comprehensible text is crucial to effective UI. Professional writers  and editors should work with software developers on UI text as an  integral part of the design process. Have them work on text early  because text problems often reveal design problems. If your team has  trouble explaining a design, quite often it is the design, not the  explanation, that needs improving.</p>
<ul>
<li>During focused, immersive reading, people read in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order (in Western cultures).</li>
<li>When using software, users aren't immersed in the UI itself but in  their work. Consequently, users don't read UI text—they scan it.</li>
<li>When scanning a window, users may appear to be reading text when in  reality they are filtering it. They often don't truly comprehend the UI  text unless they perceive the need to.</li>

<p>you start to lose control.</p>

<p>how can you organize help inside the interface? a tour, this crazy  idea. there's real benefit because you don't really learn an application  unless you're inside of it. you have to be explorig the application to  learn it, so this is one way that you bring the two together, the  learning and the exploration of the application. organizing help content  independent of the application is somewhat of a joke in termsof  learning, because you don't learn unless you're immersed in the  applicaton and exploring it.</p>
<p>why would you want to organize help inside the interface?</p>
<p>successful examples of organizing help inside the interface? that  sungard example, tip of the day, the help links that mike hughes once  mentioned,</p>
<p>maybe you should start a series of community discussions, like the  town hall thing with paul, but record them. make them lively  discussions.</p>
<p>is this a fiction? should one even try? probably, but if you come in too late, then it's too late</p>
<p>if you were to start interacting with ixd's, what qualifies you to do  this? common sense. user interaction ad observation. your grasp of  personas and profiles.</p>
<p>will this be a more satisfying experience? you're solving a problem  on another level, not just writing about it, butactually trying to work  out all th ekinkss. the janitor model.</p>
<p>why is it that going outside the interface is less than ideal?  remember what mike hughes said about people not wanting to stop the task  that they're currently doing. yes, there's hat. also, one quickly loses  a manual if it's not integrated into the application. if it's paper,  it's gone in 2 weeks. also, it's a pain to get up and fin it. but online  help is lways there.</p>
<p>interview leah guren about organizing content. she has a lot to say about this topic. she does. i should interview her.</p>
<p>how can you just insert help in the interfqace without pissing off  designers with intruding help links? this is a key question. another key  problem is that when you bring help into the interface, you don't want  to bring too much in because the user may only need the help the first  time. each subequent time, that help material will be a clutter. sothis  is a key thing you should keep in mind.</p>
<p>read ux matters more regularly. and thetech comm journal. and intercom.</p>
<p>does twtter come in handy with this kind of situation? probably.</p>

<p>"Users go to Help only when they’re stuck and stay there only until  they feel unstuck. In other words, users will not spend a lot of time  reading Help. Instead, they return to action mode as soon as they know  enough to take the next action. This is true for two reasons: Reading  text online is physically demanding; Users would rather be working in an  application than reading about it."</p>

<p>Before graphic user interfaces, text was the primary means of both  input and output defining human-computer interactions. Even today, much  of the information user interfaces present is textual. Therefore, we  should notunderestimate how the right text treatment can measurably  improve user productivity and increase user satisfaction.</p>
<p>---------------------------------</p>
<p>creative synthesis 2</p>
<p>how do you establish when you should put text in the interface?  designers tend to maintain that it's intuitive. i think you have to do  some usability testing? or just persuade pm's on the different ways that  the same text might be interpreted.  you do have to stand up and make a  casefor this, but you can't make that case if you're not involved early  enough to where people actually listen to you. i remember sending 25  bugs to a QA guy who completely ignored them. if your role on these  projects is going to be relegated to this outsider, you might as well  not even make the effort, because being an outsider sucks.</p>
<p>is there a way to deliver help such that users feel that they're  inside the application still? that they haven't left it? you need more  interface text. need a way to pass i content into pop-ups in an  effective way that you can control.</p>
<p>if the text is placed in the UI in a static element position, is it  almost the same as not putting it there at all? not really. the text is  still there. you just have to make it more readable.</p>
<p>how much does text control the interface? the interface is a lot more  textul than i've given it credit. really. we should be involved much  earlier.</p>
<p>how can you add text to a ui unless you're involved early on? you  can't. if you're documentig on emonth prior to release, then it's too  late.</p>
<p>what's the argument for bringing help inside the UI? people don't  want to separate from their task at hand to do something. we learn by  doing, so if you separate the instructional text from the action, you  diminish the learning potential.</p>
<p>what do you do when a designer uses the wrong word but you can't find  a better one? not sure. this comes up more than anything else. employ  more poetry?</p>
<p>can you look at a page and identify the actionable objects? yes, but i can't always put help there.</p>
<p>how do you balance length with clarity? more than a tweet, add a help link.</p>
<p>what about hints and helps that appear when you're only in a specific field? not bad.</p>
<p>research 2</p>
<p>talking to an interaction designer. not particularly hostile to  on-screen text. depends on the user. is picky about how the text is  shown. must be brief.  there are more elegant ways of putting text in  the interface -- expandable sections, pop-ups that use jquery. the  ability to turn pop-ups on or off. says flickr has a good example.</p>
<p>mike hughes calls interface text instructional text. others call it narrative interface.</p>
<p>one problem is the forest versus the trees with interface text.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stc.org/ConfProceed/1998/PDFs/00125.pdf">The Narrative User Interface</a>, by Nancy Raiken, Diane Stielstra, Richard Bloch.</p>
<p>Typical office workers use five to seven applications in the course of a day: an Office suite, e-mail, a<br />
scheduler, a browser, and other specialized applications. Each of these products currently makes<br />
the same claim on the users to learn and retain its intricacies. But when user assistance is no longer a<br />
separate application, users don’t need to go out of the context in which their problem arose and into a<br />
different environment to solve the problem. Because users don’t have to break their concentration to find<br />
answers to their problem, we’re not adding to their mental clutter or cognitive load.</p>
<p>/</p>
<p>Corporate costs for both formal and informal training are lowered because people learn as they work.</p>
<p>/</p>
<p>Because an application has a single user interface, how do we provide instructions for both novice and<br />
experienced users? All of the issues we currently consider—learning style, clarity, brevity, and so on—<br />
also are important for instructions in the interface. We should consider employing new technologies, such as<br />
dynamic HTML and natural language query, to address some of these issues.</p>
<p>In addition, to integrate Help into the interface, writers and editors need to work directly within the resource files<br />
(code). Issues of ownership, review cycles, and change requests become more complicated. We not only have<br />
the possibility of daily changes, but we risk a loss of control over our traditional product.</p>
<p>Users go to Help for only two reasons: They are confused about something on the current screen, or they need to<br />
find out how to accomplish a specific task. The narrative UI solves the first problem, but do we still need a Help<br />
system for the second one? Or would a better way of searching the interface solve the problem?</p>

<p>As the user selects an action, the display changes to show the action  being accomplished. If some condition necessary for that action is not  present, a message appears immediately to tell the user what must be  done before the selected action can be accomplished. As we tested the  system, our users suggested clearer wording for messages to help them  visualize the actions needed to fix problems.</p>
<p>Writers were limited in their ability to pick good titles in previous  releases because they were only involved at a late stage….In contrast,  the Money 2000 team involved writers at the earliest stages of the  design process. This brought valuable input on screen titles when it  could still help the design. If a screen was too complex to permit a  clear title, the writers could suggest the page be redesigned. By the  end of the project, the writers and designers believed the screen titles  were clearer and stronger than in previous versions. The writers also  found it easier to explain new pages, making the job of documenting the  product simpler. All team members thought that involving all disciplines  in the design phase made the product better and easier to use.<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997506"><br />

<p>As the design progressed, the team realized that documentation  writers and editors should be involved in coming up with screen titles  because their expertise included choosing words. Writers were limited in  their ability to pick good titles in previous releases because they  were only involved at a late stage. Screens were typically given  temporary working titles by designers or programmers. These titles were  used until late in the product cycle when writers were asked to come up  with final screen titles. At that point, it was too late to rework  poorly designed screens that resisted effective titles.</p>

<p>And try not to put links in your text, especially in the middle of a  sentence or paragraph. If you have links that relate to your text, put  them at the end, like footnotes. Give your visitors a chance to read  your text before sending them somewhere else.</p>

<p>Although Mac OS X uses graphics as a primary means of user-computer  interaction, text is prevalent throughout the interface for such things  as button names, pop-up menu labels, dialog messages, and onscreen help.  Using text consistently and clearly is a critical component of  interface design.</p>
<p>Your product development team should include a skilled writer who is  responsible for reviewing all user-visible onscreen text as well the  instructional documentation. The writer should refer to the Apple  Publications Style Guide for guidance on Apple-specific terminology.</p>

<p>what's the real problem you're trying to solve now? not so much what  to provide, but how? you need to probably have a little more grounding  than simply pointing out word cohice.</p>
<p>how do you move beyond limitations of space when you're in a ver  limited space and you have to be brief? expandable stuff, pop-ups.</p>
<p>how do you insert yourself early in a project so that you have this  voice? i think you have to prove your worth, as they said. you have to  provide enough insight that people take you one level higher. it's a  matter of inserting yourself in such a way that you prove your worth.  the problem is that you usually don't have the benefit of close user  analysis at this point.</p>
<p>does the language used in an interface really require a skilled  writer? it seems somewhat basic. this is a key point. because you're  strength is in the long sentence, not the 1-2 worder.</p>
<p>you don't start out with people giving you this role. so how do you change this?</p>
<p>if you look at at interface, circle all the text. certanly with  wordpress there is a ton fo text. what about other apps? i think that  first of all, you have to be committeed to this philosophy, that you  belong, that you're not just playing another role, but that the  interface is actually really a lot of text.</p>
<p>what principles do you use for naming of tabs and buttons etc?</p>
<p>equally important is not just text, but hierarchy, color, weight,  relationships, positioning, size -- all of these design aspects speak to  the meaning of the word as much as the words.  so it's not as if the  design is meaningless to communicate concepts, right? if you as a writer  are just sticking to text, then you are somewhat crippled, because your  text can be overridden by the design aspects around the contnet that  communicate meaning as well.</p>
<p>how is ultimate fighter like this? it's a battle, you go in with the  idea that you're going to battle? seems like it might be a wrong  metaphor for this.</p>
<p>how do you even get a seat at the table so that you can peform this  role? so often this will be an exerceise in furstration, becasue the  type of language required to perform this sort of skill is not something  that people feel deficient in. they feel like they can all do it.</p>
<p>do skills in writing essays translate into creating interfaces? maybe it's a different kind of language skill.</p>
<p>writers should really focus on their strengths in what they can add to a project, right?</p>
<p>I've never actually analyzed an interface like i might an essay,b ut  maybe you could break it down like this? amybe there is enough parallel  and corallary that you could approach it in a similar way? instead of a  thesis, a centrla task. supporting paragraphs translate to supporting  workflows to the task, or something. I think it takes somewhat to pick  apart the nuances of language and to identify how the same words and  phrases can be interpreted in seventeen different ways, and then to  rewrite it so that you don't have all of these alternate meanings.</p>
<p>some examples, submit linked item, crunching, burning, akismet, rss,  author/writer/communicator, allocate/assign, drill down, URL,  users,  memory, clipboard,  there are some words that you will really duke out  because no good word fits. and that's probably where your strength lies.  identify problematic word choices and really hone in on them. so much  of an interface is textual.</p>
<p>one must also consider the way words might be translated, since they don't alwyas translate the same</p>

<p>As I have noted, it’s easiest to strengthen relationships if you make  others’ lives easier. If you can prove over time that your advice is  useful, that you’re willing to spend time with a developer as a person  (not just as a developer), and that you’re willing to treat the  developers as equals, you’ll gradually strengthen your relationships to  the point that people will come to you for advice without being asked.</p>
