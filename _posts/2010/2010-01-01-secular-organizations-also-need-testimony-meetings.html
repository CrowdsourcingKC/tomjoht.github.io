<p>At a department Christmas social the other day, we had a brief meeting following lunch where people could spontaneously share their feelings about work or anything really. I have to say that it felt a little strange, but at the same time it gave me a lot to think about.</p>
<p>In case you're not Mormon (and 99% of my readers aren't), a testimony meeting is something that Mormons (or Latter-day Saints) do once a month for their church meetings. Rather than listening to several members give talks, anyone who feels the desire can spontaneously walk up to the front podium and say pretty much whatever they want for as long as they want. This can be both exciting and dangerous, or dreadful and dull, depending on who gets up and what they choose to say.</p>
<p>The only time I've seen someone be asked to sit down was in Harlem when a half-crazy lady got up to say she was the fifth bride of Christ.Â More commonly, people relate brief experiences, say what they feel inside, and oftentimes get choked up.</p>
<p>Some testimony meetings are inspiring. Others are filled with long spaces of tense silence while people wait for someone to go to the front.</p>
<p>Because I work for the LDS Church's IT department, we sometimes allow people to share their thoughts or feelings at the end of meetings, such as our Christmas social. This brings up an interesting mixture of church and work -- a mixture that is undoubtedly a new experience for most people. It is exactly this mixture that caused me to reflect.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it feels good to be in the Church IT environment where I am. Most of my colleagues are returned missionaries who have been back from their missions about ten years. We probably look very similar -- for the most part, white, males, 28 to 40 years old, active, fathers of families, short hair, clean cut, shaven.</p>
<p>Most of us love our jobs. We know we're privileged to hold the positions we have. It is almost like being grouped with dozens of former mission companions -- you feel solidarity and trust with each other, because you feel you're all on the same team. Most people are hard-working and passionate. We have families to support and Church responsibilities to fulfill.</p>
<p>And yet, while this environment feels comfortable and energizing, when we open up our meetings to share our thoughts and feelings, I tense up a bit. I'm not used to opening up that side of me at work. It's not that I fear public speaking -- I've given almost 20 presentations this year. I actually like speaking and being in control of the topic and moment.</p>
<p>But revealing your feelings about a higher purpose in front of your work colleagues seems to be another dimension. It's not something up for discussion and dissection. It's a personal experience and belief. I don't exactly know what to say. Or how to say it. So I look at the floor, and my heart starts pounding a bit during the moments of silence, when we're waiting for the next person to go to the front. When that person does go to the front, I feel a temporary relief. But also a sense of self-loathing for my lack of courage to go and get up there.</p>
<p>It is an interesting thing, combining work with church. I'm not entirely sure how to properly mix them. As I was reading up on this topic, I began to see a larger idea of what spirituality at work entails. It turns out to be a huge trend in business management.</p>

X relates how they attracted people to Manpower Limited, which today is<br />
one of the largest employers in the world. He says,<br />
I had learned that finding skilled and talened people was relatively<br />
easy; what seemed to be far more difficult was to find peole with<br />
*passion.*" He then explains that his strategy was to build a business<br />
around these passions.<br />
An ex-helicopter pilot them contacted them for work. They asked him<br />
what his calling was. He said he loved to fly and used to transport<br />
people to the North Sea oilrigs off the maincoast of Scotland during<br />
the economic boom in that area.<br />
"With his expert advice, we put a plan together that resulted in the<br />
formation of a new company to maintain the helicoipter fleets servicing<br />
the oilrigs."<br />
His strategy was to find people passionate about a calling, and then<br />
"to align their Calling with our Cause, so they could create magical<br />
careers for themselves, while, at the same.....</p>
<p>"Followers are rarely inspired by greed or selfish aims for very long.<br />
To inspire people over the lon gterm, we need to ensure that the Cause<br />
is rooted in something higher than self-interest, something beyond<br />
personal or corporate gain, something that recognizes and invokes a<br />
higher purpose. Inspiration is created when followers understand how<br />
their Calling fits and services this *higher purpose* and how this<br />
alignment will resonate for them."</p>
<p>Secretan references a quote by Bill Pollard, chair emeritus of<br />
ServiceMaster, who says that "when there is an alignment between the<br />
Cause of the firm and the Calling of its people, a creative power is<br />
unleashed that results in quality service to the customer and the<br />
growth and development of the people serving. People find meaning in<br />
their work. The Cause becomes an organizing principle of<br />
effectiveness."<br />
Pollard then relates the story of a community hospital housekeeper<br />
named Shirley who gets excited about mopping and cleaning because she's<br />
not "just cleaning floors," she "sees her job as exteding to the<br />
welfare of the patient in the bed as an integral part of a team<br />
supporting the work of doctors and nurses -- she has a Cause -- a Cause<br />
that ivolves the health and welfare of others."<br />
