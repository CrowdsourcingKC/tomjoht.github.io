<p>Podcamp SLC is approaching. Thom Allen, who organizes the event, is looking for presenters,</p>
<p>You are receiving this email because you attended PodCampSLC last year, or expressed an interest this year, and we are excited to see you come out. We really need the communities support to make this a great event.</p>
