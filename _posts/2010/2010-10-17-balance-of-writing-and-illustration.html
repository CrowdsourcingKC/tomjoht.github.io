<p>This past week I've been reading Robert Horn's book on Visual Language. One of the points he makes is that you shouldn't be afraid of adding text to your visuals. The combination of visuals and text makes a powerful communication. I think it's easy to go extreme in either direction. Either we get too text heavy and neglect illustrations altogether. Or illustrators try to force their illustrations to do too much of the work.</p>
<p>why is this topic important?</p>
<p>is there a topic that comes before this topic?</p>
<p>what examples do you have of this?</p>
