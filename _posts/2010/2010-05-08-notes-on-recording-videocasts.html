<p>10 things about video</p>
<p>* 1. lighting<br />
* 2. external mic: binaural mics<br />
* 3. a hook/story. first videocast discussion the best<br />
* 4. editing video really hard, so hit record only when ready<br />
* 5. where to look<br />
* 6. length. short, so cut right to the issue.<br />
* 7. format: 720p, 30 fps. mov format. m4v format for ipod.<br />
* 8. captions and transcription<br />
* 9. need for a camera person<br />
* 10. video is really fun -- didn't think i would like it, but loved it. video is incredibly easy.<br />
* 11. need multiple people in the video -- not just one person.<br />
* 12. scheduling people ahead of time versus doing it all spontaneous.</p>
