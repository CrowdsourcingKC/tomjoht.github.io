<p>If you have a lot of photos, you can implement them into galleries and albums using the NextGen Gallery plugin. This image gallery plugin is one of the most robust plugins for uploading, managing, captioining, and tagging images. It works well if you have a lot of images that you constantly upload and display on your site.</p>
