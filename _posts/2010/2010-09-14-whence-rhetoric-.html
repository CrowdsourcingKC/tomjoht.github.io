<p>the PhD program in Tech Comm and Rhetoric</p>
<p>my dad writing to ask me about rhetoric.</p>
<p>Aristotle's Rhetoric</p>
<p>The PhD qualifies people to conduct independent research by various methods and thus to contribute to knowledge. The PhD is usually a qualification for a professorial position in a university.  The aims of study are broad knowledge of the literature on technical communication and rhetoric, specialized knowledge of some aspect of technical communication or rhetoric as reflected in the dissertation research, and ability to conduct ongoing independent research using one or more methods.</p>
<p>The PhD in Technical Communication and Rhetoric (TCR) is designed for students with an interest in rhetoric, writing, technical communication, and composition. The degree in TCR requires 45 hours of graduate work in rhetoric and technical communication beyond the bachelor's degree. An additional 15 hours may be used for a minor in a related field. Credits earned on a master's degree count toward these totals. This degree prepares students for positions in a wide range of college and university writing programs. This degree program requires courses in qualitative and quantitative research methods. The program emphasizes five broad areas of scholarship in its scholarship, coursework, and initiatives: a) Rhetoric, Composition, and Technology, b) Technical Communication, c) Rhetorics of Science and Healthcare, d) Technology, Culture, and Rhetoric, and e) Visual Rhetoric, New Media, and User-Centered Design.<br />

<p>I would urge professors to pry open a<br />
window in their ivory towers and take a<br />
good look at practical technical writing<br />
and editing. Most of the jobs in industry<br />
are in keyboarding. And today there<br />
are fewer and fewer of them. “Technical<br />
communication” is going online, where<br />
the keyboarding is done by the programmers—<br />
who, if they have a college<br />
degree, have it in engineering or computer<br />
science, not in rhetoric.<br />

<p>most everything is about rhetoric in one way or another, but not so much in a technical manual. not really trying to persuade as much as to teach.</p>
<p>------------------<br />
Technical Communication Is a Subset of Rhetoric. Rhetoric  involves creating human discourse, ranging from formal to informal, verbal to nonverbal, spoken to written. Human discourse includes thought, language, communication, and purposive action. As a study of this process, rhetoric  involves (1) the symbolic ideation and language processes that solidify our thinking, (2) the creative use of thoughts/words in a purposive manner with others (listeners, readers), (3) the communication  act (oral, written, electronic), (4) the interpretations of others, (5) the purposive action that results, and (6) the interpretation of that purposive action. Technical communication incorporates these general aspects of rhetoric; but as a subset of rhetoric, technical communication has its own focal points, particularly its function in organizational settings and its collaborative nature. </p>

<p>here's my basic idea: rhetoric is what's missing in our approach to technical communication. it's not just producing the information, but arranging and presenting it in such a way that it engages and persuades the user. we don't spend enough time focusing on this latter part.</p>
<p>depending on your purpose, your organization of the content reflects your purpose. if you're purpose is to do X, then your organization reflects that. for example, is your purpose to entertain? then your organization will be more like hulu.com. is your purpose to instruct, then your organization will be more screen by screen tutorialish. is your purpose to be more like a reference base of material? then your organization will be more like wikipedia. so organization is a function of rhetoric. this seems somewhat obvious, but how often do we analyze the rhetorical situation in technical communication? the organization rarely reflects the audience or the situation. we almost never look at this situation and organize content accordingly.</p>
<p>what if it's a situation with little time. then the organization reflects that. what if the user is a power user? then the organization reflects that. what is the purpose is to introduce the material? then the organization reflects that. you have an organization for nearly every situation. when we create informaton, we can't merely forget about the rhetorical context that the information appears in. that's why you can't talk about organization without also talking about the rhetorical context that you're in. we don't often consider rhetoric in the workplace consciously, but it is there .... everywhere.</p>
<p>Here are 10 different situations. Help would be organized differently for each of them.</p>
<p>Power user<br />
Introduction to the material<br />
Certification course<br />
User who only needs to know one facet<br />
Entertain<br />
Reference source</p>
<p>when we write help, what rhetorical context are we imagining? i'm writing from the context of how does this work? what can i do in this application, and wherat are the steps to do that task? but maybe this is totally wrong. maybe i need to imagine another rhetorical context?</p>
