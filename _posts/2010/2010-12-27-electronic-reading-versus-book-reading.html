<p>The organization I work for, the LDS Church, recently published a new website that provides an electronic, interactive reading experience for the scriptures that ventures out into new territory. The launch of this site presents readers with the question of whether the new, electronic version of the scriptures is superior to the traditional, paper-based reading experience that has dominated habits for so long.</p>
