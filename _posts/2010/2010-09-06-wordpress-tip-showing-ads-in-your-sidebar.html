<p>You can show ads in your sidebar through a simple plugin called <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp125/">WP125</a>. This plugin allows you to add and manage a collection of 125 pixel graphic ads. One note I forgot to mention in the screencast is that each ad must be <i>exactly</i> 125 x 125 pixels in size. Otherwise you'll end up with strange looking spaces in your sidebar images. </p>
