<p>The following is a guest post from Kristie Lewis.<br />
<a href="http://idratherbetellingstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/orangebar.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9119" style="border: none;" title="orangebar" src="/images/orangebar.png" alt="" width="300" height="3" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>While I've always had a passion for creative writing, I once did strongly consider pursuing a more "practical" career and switching on over to the business school my first year in college. Before making the final switch, I did some research on the web just to get a feel for the industry. There weren't as many blogs as there are today, but from what I could gather I knew right away that business just wasn’t for me—it seemed so dull. Is that true? Others would argue no, but the boring descriptions of job life really tuned me off.</p>
<p>But that's corporate blog writing for you. It isn't exactly the most "creative" or "interesting" type-of-writing you can do. Articles are often filled with jargon and typically call for a drier style. But that doesn't mean that corporate blogs and other industry-related web articles have to be boring. There are ways that you can incorporate more traditional storytelling elements in order to liven up your writing and captivate your audience more thoroughly—perhaps even convince younger students to pursue it as a profession. While techniques will vary on the subject being tackled, below are a few elements that can make your stuffy articles more engaging and interesting for your readers.</p>
<h2>Personal Anecdote</h2>
<p>One of the main issues with corporate blog writing and the likes is the fact that they're often too bland. They have no personality. No pizazz. Granted, no all subjects will call for spice, but you can make things oh-so-much-more interesting by simply leading with a personal anecdote. Personal anecdotes have the ability to not only set the entire tone of an article, but they can also help lay the foundation of your entire message—i.e. the point of your article. Take an excerpt from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://trustedadvisor.com/trustmatters/the-dishwashers-tale"><em>The Dishwasher's Tale</em></a></span> posted on Trusted Advisor, one of my favorite business blogs:</p>
<blockquote><p>"One of my biggest lessons in life came 30 years ago. I had time between University semesters. I wanted to travel to the country nearest Ireland, where I was studying, where they didn’t speak English. After getting a bus, boat, and train…I arrived at my destination: Belgium, where Flemish is the first language and French the second. Because of the language barrier, I had to work in a position that did not require customer contact. Hence my job: dishwasher."</p></blockquote>
<p>The author then goes on to describe how her job was horrible and her boss didn’t appreciate her at all. She then expands the topic and addresses how CEOs of larger companies need to appreciate their employees at work. While personal anecdotes are great, they will be unsuccessful without great character development, which leads us to our next tip—</p>
<h2>Character Development</h2>
<p>If you're going to lead with a personal anecdote, this means that <em>you </em>are the main character. Even if you only talk about yourself briefly in the introduction, you have to ensure that your audience can identify with you. That said, you need to provide enough personal information to seem likable in order to get your audience to read further. The above excerpt does a great job at this, but here is another example. Let's say you're trying to write an article on "How to Overcome Your First Failure at Work." You decide to give a personal anecdote about how you made your first big mistake at your first corporate job. You don't need to give your whole background information, but you can provide enough detail to give your audience some sort of insight of what kind of person you were back then by saying something like:</p>
<blockquote><p>"When I graduated from the University of Texas in 1995 I thought I was invincible. I graduated summa cum laude and was the only 21-year-old to get hired by the ritzy consulting firm I was working for. I never experienced much failure and I was thoroughly pleased with the direction I was heading. I learned my duties rather quickly and by the second week the training wheels came off. But then I made the most terrible mistake of my life."</p></blockquote>
<p>You have to seem relatable and likeable for your audience to connect with you (the character).</p>
<h2>Point of View</h2>
<p>Changing the point of view can also give your article a fresh new feel. While placing yourself as the main character is always welcomed, a first-person view doesn't always have to be the case. Writing in second person is also ideal. This is because adding "you" can make your reader feel more connected to the article. For example, perhaps you're trying to paint a picture for your reader and want to lay out a scenario. You can say something like:</p>
<p>"Imagine this: it's 9 a.m. sharp and you just realized that you forgot to bring in your proposal for the investor meeting that is to take place in 30 minutes. Do you cancel the meeting? Or do you run home and try to get it?"</p>
<p>Then you trail off to emphasize why backing up your documents on remote data storage websites like DropBox is so crucial. It may seem a bit strange but you can also write in the view of an inanimate object, depending on what topic you're trying to cover. For example, perhaps you're trying to rave about a new device that makes transactions so much easier. You can start off with:</p>
<p>"I give receipts for every transaction. I'm much faster and take up less room than the x500. I’m the new model— x1200G." This is sort of a bad example but the point is don't limit your creativity.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, try to remain using one point of view throughout the entire blogpost.</p>
<h2>Setting</h2>
<p>Lastly, you want to make sure that you set up the proper setting/location for your audience. It helps your audience gain context for the story to fully understand your point of the story. This is typically accomplished through the use of description and your word choice. Think outside the box and don't be afraid to use "flowery" language when it seems appropriate. Take the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.theduckandbunny.com/what-is-a-snuggery">Duck and Bunny</a></span> restaurant's website for example. It uses the word snuggery to describe how the facility is cozy and tranquil so readers already know what kind of atmosphere they will be walk into before they even get there:</p>
<p>"We’d like to think that our little Snuggery offers a sanctuary away from the noise."</p>
<p>Their word choice helps paint the setting.</p>
<p>Of course there are other storytelling elements that can be used when writing a corporate blogpost. Just remember not to limit yourself and try to craft an article that you yourself would enjoy reading.</p>
