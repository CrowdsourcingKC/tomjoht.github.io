<p>similar to my other reviews of religious books<br />
structural complexity<br />
few people understand the BOM<br />
not a whole lot of mormonism in the BOM -- no temple ceremonies, garments, super celebration of family, polygamy, etc. eugene england's post on that. if LDS Church had only the BOM as scripture and guide, the church would be a lot less controversial.</p>
<p>writing perspective. writing primarily functions as way to remember, to preserve. </p>
<p>3 accounts: mulekites, jaredites, nephites. only one took with them a record.</p>
<p>interesting that it contains copied over passages from Isaiah and the New Testament</p>
<p>bart ehrman on forgery. anachronisms -- secret societies to get power are downfall, but that theme is downplayed.</p>
<p>the koran.</p>
<p>chloroform in print</p>
<p>a lot of war</p>
<p>mormon is a historian writer. joseph smith is a translator. </p>
<p>process of translation. peering into a stone.</p>
<p>joseph smith on studying scripture -- asks what question was person trying to answer.</p>
<p>chiasmus</p>
<p>chapter breaks are modernizations, as is the punctuation.</p>
<p>they couldn't express their faith with the same degree of power as they could leave and preach it -- mormon 12.</p>
<p>116 pages is lost. has 1 and 2 nephi tacked onto the beginning, ether tacked on at end. </p>
<p>tells a hundredth part of what happened. </p>
<p>persons writing were often prophets. record keeping right was hereditary.</p>
<p>not many women appear in it</p>
<p>is it forged? nearly impossible.</p>
<p>why did the people annihiliate themselves? </p>
<p>even critics who leave church don't denounce book of mormon. written on whitmer's grave.</p>
