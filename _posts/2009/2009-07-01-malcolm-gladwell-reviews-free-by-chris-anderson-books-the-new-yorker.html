<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/07/06/090706crbo_books_gladwell?currentPage=1">Malcolm Gladwell reviews Free by Chris Anderson: Books: The New Yorker</a>. I've been wanting to read this book by Chris Anderson for a while. He talks about how the Internet is trending towards the idea that information is free. Gladwell provides some criticism and analysis of the idea.</p>
