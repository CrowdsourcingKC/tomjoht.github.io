<p>Over the last month, you've been seeing various posts on my site about the seven deadly sins of blogging (being <a href="http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2009/09/15/seven-deadly-sins-of-blogging-1-being-fake/">fake</a>, <a href="http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2009/10/04/seven-deadly-sins-of-blogging-2-being-irrelevant/">irrelevant</a>, <a href="http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2009/10/13/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-blogging-sin-3-being-boring/">boring</a>, <a href="http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2009/10/17/seven-deadly-sins-of-blogging-sin-4-being-unreadable/">unreadable</a>, <a href="http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2009/10/17/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-blogging-sin-5-being-irresponsible/">irresponsible</a>, <a href="http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2009/10/18/the-seven-sins-of-blogging-sin-6-being-unfindable/">unfindable,</a> and <a href="http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2009/10/31/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-blogging-sin-7-being-inattentive/">inattentive</a>). I mentioned at the beginning of my seven deadly sins series that I was preparing for some upcoming presentations on blogging. I first presented on the Seven Deadly Sins of Blogging at <a href="http://www.webworksroundup.com/">WebWorks Roundup 2009</a>. I gave a similar presentation to the <a href="http://stc-suncoast.org">STC-Suncoast chapter</a> (in Tampa, Florida) last night. The latter one I recorded.</p>
<p>While the content of both presentations was supposed to be the same, that's not how it worked out. The presentation to Suncoast kind of veers off in different directions half way through. I also decided to bookend this podcast with a few thoughts before and after the presentation while driving (hence the length).</p>
