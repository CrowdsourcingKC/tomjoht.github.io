<p>After I posted the last screencasts, Scott Skibell pointed me to Mailchimp's screencasts/video demos as well. These screencasts from Mailchimp are also pretty amazing. Lots of tilting and motion -- maybe too much, actually. But still, the effect is somewhat mesmerizing. And the audio couldn't be any richer. </p>
