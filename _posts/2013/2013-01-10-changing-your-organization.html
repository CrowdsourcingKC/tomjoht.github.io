<p>In a recent comment, Keith Soltys said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Sometimes the technical issues around content reuse and publishing are the easiest to resolve â€“ organizational and cultural changes are much harder to implement. This is something that you didn't really touch on in your post, and I'd like to see your thoughts on the subject.</p></blockquote>
