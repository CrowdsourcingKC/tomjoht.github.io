<p>I like to get back in touch with my LI connections from time to time. So, How is it going with you lately? I'm glad to be connected to a very active technical writer :) no wonder you got the "#1 most influential tech comm blogger in 2011". What does that mean to you?</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts!</p>
