<p>what's the issue: lots of variety on the spectrum. told too late, then you don't have enough time to do a good job. but there's a flip side: told early enough, but not enough time to get involved until it reaches crisis situation. </p>
<p>you could tell people there's a need for help, but then you need to have the resources to deliver it. </p>
