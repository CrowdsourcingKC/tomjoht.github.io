<p>It's been a few months since I've sent out a message across this LDS Technical Writers Group list. Sorry for the absence of communication. My responsibilities have switched a bit. I'm now focused more on user awareness than user education. As such I've been creating, soliciting, and editing content for the LDSTech blog (https://tech.lds.org).</p>
<p>One of our goals with the LDSTech blog is to increase involvement in the community projects by publishing information about each project. If you browse through the recent posts on tech.lds.org, you can see a couple of articles addressing community projects. More are in the works. </p>
<p>My strategy has been to ask each project manager to write an article about his or her project, usually answering a series of questions. Here's where I need your help: when these project managers respond back, the article usually needs to be edited. Sometimes the edit is light, other times more extensive. </p>
<p>If you're interested in being an LDSTech editor, let me know. I've created a new community project that you can join for this in the Projects section of LDSTech. As an LDSTech editor, you will help edit the blog articles for LDSTech. You need to have a good grasp of language and style, with the ability to make sentences clear and readable. As you edit the articles, always keep in mind the blog's purpose: to increase involvement in the community projects.</p>
<p>The time workload for this project can adapt to your availability. When I have an article to edit, I'll email the project group and ask who would like to edit an article. If you're able to edit it, hopefully you can turn it around in a few days. </p>
<p>If you're interested in becoming an LDSTech editor, here's what to do:<br />
Go to https://tech.lds.org.<br />
Sign in with your LDS Account in the sidebar.<br />
On the top navigation bar, click Projects.<br />
If prompted, sign the contributor's agreement.<br />
Click the Projects subtab.<br />
Scroll down to the LDSTech Blog project and click the project name in the left column.<br />
Click Join.<br />
When you join the project, you will be listed on the project team and I will receive an e-mail. If you have any questions, let me know. </p>
<p>Tom</p>
