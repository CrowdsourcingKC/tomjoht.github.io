In an earlier post, I mentioned that in 2018, I plan to explore ways to simplify complexity as a way to deepen the value I provide. I created a new section on my site called \"Simplifying Complexity\" for this content, and I added the first topic there: [Switching between macro and micro views with embedded maps](idratherbewriting.com/simplifying-complexity/macro-micro.html). The basic principle is as follows:

> To help users navigate a complex system, provide a way for users to switch between macro and micro views of the system. One of the easiest techniques to enable this view switching is to embed a map (at the top of each relevant topic) that shows the path to achieving a goal.
