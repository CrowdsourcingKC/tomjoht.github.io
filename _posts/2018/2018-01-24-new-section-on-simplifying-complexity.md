summary: "In an earlier post on value, I mentioned that in 2018, I plan to explore some innovative ways to simplify complexity in order to deepen the value I provide as a technical writer. To accommodate this content, I created a new section on my site called \"Simplifying Complexity.\" So far I've added just one topic there on navigation maps. I argue that toggling between micro and macro views of a system, often through embedded workflow maps, can help users better understand and orient themselves in complex systems."

You can read the post here: [Switching between macro and micro views with embedded maps](idratherbewriting.com/simplifying-complexity/macro-micro.html).

The micro-macro principle is as follows:

> To help users navigate a complex system, provide a way for users to switch between macro and micro views of the system. One of the easiest techniques to enable this view switching is to embed a map (at the top of each relevant topic) that shows the path to achieving a goal.

You can get to this section by clicking the [Complexity](http://idratherbewriting.com/simplifying-complexity) button on my main navigation bar.
