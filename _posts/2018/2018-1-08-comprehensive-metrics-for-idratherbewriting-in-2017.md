title: "5 unexpected realizations after a comprehensive review of my 2017 site metrics"
categories:
- general
keywords: trends, analytics, hits, interests, topics
summary: "I usually start the beginning of the year by reviewing metrics for the previous year. Not only do I gather these metrics to update my advertising page, it also helps me better understand my readers, the trending topics and issues, and other points of interest. After reviewing data, I draw some conclusions about what it means. The trends and other points of interest help inform my direct for 2018."

{{site.data.alerts.tip}}These metrics are also useful if you're planning a tech comm event. My top recommendation: Put on a tech comm event in San Francisco, New York, or Bangalore and cover these topics: Swagger, agile, quick reference guides, trends, plain language, and tech writing careers. {{site.data.alerts.end}}

If you want to skip over the data details, jump down to the [Conclusions](#conclusions) and [Directions](#directions). Note that while my [2018 trends post](http://idratherbewriting.com/2018/01/02/technical-writing-trends-2018-and-2017-review/) was more conceptual and speculative, this post is more based on data to my site.

## Number of page views and sessions

From Jan 1, 2017 to Dec 31, 2017, idratherbewriting.com had about 845,000 page views. Here's a chart from Google Analytics.

<figure><img src="/images/2018googleanalytics.png" alt="I&#039;d Rather Be Writing gets about 845,000 page views per year, or 2,300 page views a day." /> <figcaption>I'd Rather Be Writing gets about 845,066 page views per year, or 2,300 page views a day.</figcaption></figure>

(There was a slight dip mid-year because I split out the [API doc site](http://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/) into a separate Jekyll project and didn't have analytics configured correctly for a while.)

Here's another slice of analytics focusing more on audience:

<figure><img src="/images/2018analyticsuseranalysis.png" alt="Breakdown of analytics" /> <figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{{site.data.alerts.note}} How do "page views" and "sessions" differ? A page view is when the page loads, regardless of whether it's the same visitor or a different visitor. A session refers to a *unique visit* to the site. If the same visitor views 10 pages, it only counts as a single session. The average number of page views per session is 1.58.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Comparison of metrics to 2016

How did the metrics compare to the previous year? They're up a bit:

## Number of posts written

I wrote just 72 posts this year. In 2016, I wrote 96. In 2015, I wrote 145. In 2014, I wrote 117. In 2013, I wrote 88. However, I probably added 25 pages to my [API documentation site](http://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/), so the numbers probably balance out.

## Percent of traffic to API doc site versus regular site

My [API documentation site](http://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/) received 309,000 visits out of the 845,000 overall visits. This is about 36% of the traffic to my site.

## Visits to Jekyll theme

Mid-way through the year, I started tracking hits on my Jekyll documentation theme. There were 73,000 page views.

<img src="/images/googleanalyticsjekylltheme.png" />

However, I'm not sure if these metrics are skewed because the theme gets forked and maybe people leave in the original Google Analytics code. At any rate, I have this analytics code separated out from my main analytics because I don't display ads on this theme. Still, this is a considerable amount of traffic.

## Conclusions {#conclusions}

What conclusions can we gather from this data? One could use this information as a starting point for a more detailed analysis. For example, what topics are of most interest to technical writers? What is the ideal post length? What characteristics do the most popular posts share? For example, are their titles phrased as questions, as Larry Kunz observed with his topic content? Do the titles contain other trigger words, like "realizations" and "failure" that generate immediate interest?

Why are my search metrics dominated by questions about "swagger" but not about other aspect of tech comm? Does this point to two different segmentations of my audience -- those who arrive by search might be developers looking for information on Swagger, whereas my core readership are technical communicators?

Why are retweets and likes on social media so much more coveted while the larger traffic from Google's organic search (73% of the traffic!) doesn't receive the same attention? Why should the About page really contain, and why is it so important for people?

Well, now that we have actual data, let's make a few simple observations.

### Realization #1: These 7 topics matter most to technical communicators

These topics seem to matter most to technical communicators:

* Swagger
* Agile
* Trends
* Plain language
* Quick reference guides
* TC careers, certificate programs
* Learning

Why these topics? Just as users search for answers related to "pain points" they're facing, are readers also searching for answers to their pain points? Perhaps we have questions, challenges, or other issues with these topics that make them particularly relevant to us.

Agile is a hot button for tech writers, probably because of all the problems tech writers face in trying to integrate into the agile flow. Swagger and OpenAPI specifications are hot topics too because they are confusing and difficult to implement. Writers care about language, simplicity, and user-centered design, so these topics are frequently viewed. Topics for beginners are also popular no doubt because of the difficulty of breaking into the field.

### Realization #2: Popular post titles include several trigger words

Post titles with "realizations" and "failures" and "misconceptions" and "limits" are popular. Why? People are intrigued by the proposition that what they previously thought to be true actually isn't. Don't we all like to have the tables turned on our sense of knowledge?

Does the data here mean that I should write more about swagger, agile, trends, plain language, quick reference guides, TC careers, certificate programs, and learning? And that I should work the terms "realizations" and "misconceptions" and "failure" into each of these terms? for example:

* 5 misconceptions about tech writing certificate programs
* The failure of plain language
* Realizations of a tech comm agile scrum master
* 3 tech writing trends that failed
* What I realized in designing quick reference layouts

Hmmm, *I* would click on each of these articles. So maybe there is something to this game. Put the right buzzwords with the right trigger words in your title, and you've got a great hook. I'm not sure how long game can last, but it might be fun. (Can you tell where I got the motivation for this post's title?)

### Realization #3: Writing posts based on traffic is a continuous feedback loop

I wanted to increase site traffic, these techniques might build more readership, search results clicks, and more. In 2017, I did massively rewrite and expand on the Swagger and OpenAPI content in my API doc site. I focused a bit on agile and trends as well.

But if I only write towards what's popular, the trajectory of my content becomes more like a tennis game where the players move one step closer to each other with each hit. Based on my 2016 metrics, I write about what gets the most hits &mdash; trends. The new trends post goes viral and drives more traffic. So by analyzing the traffic, I see that "trends" is super important. I wrote another post on trends. Bang, even more hits. Now I'm getting asked to speak on trends and people perceive me as a trends expert. In time, my blog is now reframed as "Technical Writing Trends." When people think of technical writing trends, my name ()"Tom Johnson") immediately surfaces. Is that what I want? Which audience am I writing for?

What audience am I not reaching by not addressing other topics? If I had never written about trends, I would have never connected with that audience. What about all the readers for ... say ... science communication?

I know we should write tech docs based on our user's pain points, but at the same time, I am not writing for my readers. I write for myself. I ask questions that interest me. I explore topics I want to know more about. I explore areas that I want to become more familiar with. If it so happens that others have similar interests and questions, then great, we have a connection through our shared interest. That's how the niche communities on the Internet form. The potential audience online is vast enough that I don't need to worry about what my readers care about. My affinity towards topics will pull out those niche readers from the cracks and crevices of the the virtual earth. Those people searching for "context sensitive help techniques in jekyll" will suddenly find a new information source in me. Maybe.

In 2018, I want to align myself with who I authentically am &mdash; in ways like I've never done before. This might involve me challenging more assumptions, being creatively introspective. Inside I am a curious, wandering philosopher that was never trained or focused.

### Realization #4: Organic search trumps social media likes and retweets

Despite the buzz that comes from sharing content on social media, traffic from social media accounts for a small percentage of site visitors (about 3%). Most people arrive at my site through Google search (73%). There's something biologically addictive (endorphin release?) that happens when you see a retweet or a like, when you see a post shared so much that an actual fire icon appears in Feedly.


But maybe social media is far too overrated. Perhaps SEO for Google search should be the overriding concern in each article? On the other hand, most people aren't searching for many of the topics I wrote about. They're searching for "swagger tutorial" and "javascript listeners" and "api authorization" &mdash; not necessarily "plain language" or "rules for simplicity," etc. Or are searching for more tech comm terms but I don't rank high enough to garner clicks from the results?

Note: It's unfortunate that the OpenAPI initiative rebranded the Swagger spec as "OpenAPI." It seems many people search for swagger, not OpenAPI. In choosing to use the "correct" terms for this space, I probably sacrificed a lot of potential hits.

## Realization #5: Ideal content length is ... long

I once read that the ideal length for the most popular posts was 1,600 words. This seemed to run against conventional wisdom about ideal lengths for online content, which typically put the recommended word length at around 500-800 words. Is the ideal actually twice that? I meticulously measured word counts for these more popular posts and averaged them out. The average, quite astonishingly, corresponds with the 1,600 word count that research backs. In [The Ideal Length of Everything Online, Backed by Research](https://blog.bufferapp.com/the-ideal-length-of-everything-online-according-to-science), they report that the ideal blog length can be calculated based on the average reading duration.

> ... an ideal blog post would be one that people read. And Medium’s research on this front says that the ideal blog post is seven minutes long.
>
> ## Best post length
>
> <p><img src="/images/mediumidealblogpostlength.png" alt="Ideal length of a blog post" /></p>
>
> To arrive at this number, Medium measured the average total seconds spent on each post and compared this to the post length. All Medium posts are marked with a time signature for how long the read should be. After adjusting their analysis for a glut of shorter posts (overall, 74% of posts are under 3 minutes long and 94% are under 6 minutes long), they came to their conclusion:
>
> And there we have it: the average total seconds rises for longer posts, peaks at 7 minutes, and then declines.
>
> And in terms of word count, a 7-minute read comes in around 1,600 words.

They followed up this post with another [updated one](https://blog.bufferapp.com/optimal-length-social-media), this one based on [blog content audit of 595 posts](https://blog.bufferapp.com/content-audit). They found:

> 1,600 words makes for a good guideline to get started.
>
> We’ve found that 2,500-word posts tend to do best for us.

Here's their graphic:

<figure><img src="/images/word-count-social-shares-1024x668.png" /><figcaption>They conclude: "Our posts that exceed 2,500 words receive an average of 6,600 social shares—far and away the most popular post length on the blog."</figcaption></figure>

A few years ago, I engaged in endless debates about the ideal length of content for documentation. See [Why Long Topics Are Better for the User
](http://idratherbewriting.com/2013/05/06/why-long-topics-are-better-for-the-user/) and [Do Short Topics Make Information More Findable?](http://idratherbewriting.com/2013/05/05/do-short-topics-make-information-more-findable/) and [http://idratherbewriting.com/2013/04/22/does-dita-encourage-authors-to-fragment-information-into-a-million-little-pieces/](Does DITA Encourage Authors to Fragment Information into a Million Little Pieces?).

If you think about it, given how many services analyze the most popular content on their sites, like content science, we shouldn't have need to conclude debates about optimal content length with "it depends." The results are in. Longer is usually better. Shoot for 1,600 words but don't be afraid to jack it up 2-3 times that length.

How do we square 1,600 words with the 1.58 minute average reading time? Most likely the high bounce rate or less-than-ten-second reading times for many visitors undercuts what is probably the normal reading time for a post. That is, for posts that are actually relevant to readers (removing the < 10 second visits), what is the average time they spend reading them? It is probably at least 3-4 minutes. In that time span, readers can absorb more material. They can jump and scan around more. But probably most important, with a 1,600 word post, readers feel it delivers significant enough value to share, bookmark, and otherwise promote.
