title: "Comprehensive 2017 Metrics for I'd Rather Be Writing"
categories:
- general
keywords: trends, analytics, hits, interests, topics
summary: "I usually start the beginning of the year by reviewing metrics for the previous year. Not only do I gather these metrics to update my advertising page, it also helps me better understand my readers, the trending topics and issues, and other points of interest. After reviewing data, I draw some conclusions about what it means. The trends and other points of interest help inform my direct for 2018."

{{site.data.alerts.tip}}These metrics are also useful if you're planning a tech comm event. My top recommendation: Put on a tech comm event in San Francisco, New York, or Bangalore and cover these topics: Swagger, agile, quick reference guides, trends, plain language, and tech writing careers. {{site.data.alerts.end}}

If you want to skip over the data details, jump down to the [Conclusions](#conclusions) and [Directions](#directions). Note that while my [2018 trends post](http://idratherbewriting.com/2018/01/02/technical-writing-trends-2018-and-2017-review/) was more conceptual and speculative, this post is more based on data to my site.

## Number of page views and sessions

From Jan 1, 2017 to Dec 31, 2017, idratherbewriting.com had about 845,000 page views. Here's a chart from Google Analytics.

<figure><img src="/images/2018googleanalytics.png" alt="I&#039;d Rather Be Writing gets about 845,000 page views per year, or 2,300 page views a day." /> <figcaption>I'd Rather Be Writing gets about 845,066 page views per year, or 2,300 page views a day.</figcaption></figure>

(There was a slight dip mid-year because I split out the [API doc site](http://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/) into a separate Jekyll project and didn't have analytics configured correctly for a while.)

Here's another slice of analytics focusing more on audience:

<figure><img src="/images/2018analyticsuseranalysis.png" alt="Breakdown of analytics" /> <figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{{site.data.alerts.note}} How do "page views" and "sessions" differ? A page view is when the page loads, regardless of whether it's the same visitor or a different visitor. A session refers to a *unique visit* to the site. If the same visitor views 10 pages, it only counts as a single session. The average number of page views per session is 1.58.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Comparison of metrics to 2016

How did the metrics compare to the previous year? They're up a bit:

Write the Docs podcasts didn't have nearly as many hits. The highest show, [Write the Docs Podcast #3 - Trends for 2017](http://idratherbewriting.com/2017/02/03/wtd-podcast-trends-2017/) had just 587 downloads. The average number of downloads was 300-400 per episode.

## Number of posts written

I wrote just 72 posts this year. In 2016, I wrote 96. In 2015, I wrote 145. In 2014, I wrote 117. In 2013, I wrote 88. However, I probably added 25 pages to my [API documentation site](http://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/), so the numbers probably balance out.

## Percent of traffic to API doc site versus regular site

My [API documentation site](http://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/) received 309,000 visits out of the 845,000 overall visits. This is about 36% of the traffic to my site.

## Visits to Jekyll theme

Mid-way through the year, I started tracking hits on my Jekyll documentation theme. There were 73,000 page views.

<img src="/images/googleanalyticsjekylltheme.png" />

However, I'm not sure if these metrics are skewed because the theme gets forked and maybe people leave in the original Google Analytics code. At any rate, I have this analytics code separated out from my main analytics because I don't display ads on this theme. Still, this is a considerable amount of traffic.

## Conclusions {#conclusions}

Here are a few conclusions:

The hottest topics were as follows:

* Swagger
* Agile
* Trends
* Plain language
* Quick reference guides
* TC careers, certificate programs
* Learning

Why these topics? We click what we're interested to learn about. Perhaps we have questions, challenges, or other issues with these topics that make them particularly relevant to us. Agile is a hot button for tech writers, probably because of all the problems tech writers face in trying to integrate into the agile flow. Swagger and OpenAPI specifications are hot topics too because these are confusing and difficult to implement. Writers care about language, simplicity, and user-centered design, so these topics are frequently viewed. Topics for beginners are also popular no doubt because of the difficulty of breaking into the field.

Post titles with "realizations" and "failures" or "failed" are popular.

Another constant reminder: Despite the buzz that comes from sharing content on social media, traffic from social media accounts for a small percentage of site visitors. Most people arrive at my site through Google search.

I'm blown away by how my search analytics are dominated by searches for "swagger." It's unfortunate that they rebranded the spec as "OpenAPI." It seems many people search for swagger but then end up reading my OpenAPI tutorial.

Does the data here mean that I should write more about swagger, agile, trends, plain language, quick reference guides, TC careers, certificate programs, and learning? Sure, if I wanted to increase site traffic, these topics might build more readership, search results clicks, and more. In 2017, I did massively rewrite and expand on the Swagger and OpenAPI content in my API doc site. I focused a bit on agile and trends as well. But if I only write towards what's popular, the interaction becomes more circular. One writes about what gets the most hits; the massive hits drives more posts on the topic, which drive more hits, which drive more posts on the topic, and so on. But what audience am I not reaching by not addressing other topics? If I had never written about Swagger, I would have never connected with that audience.

I know we should write for our users, but at the same time, I am not writing for my readers. I write for myself. I ask questions that interest me. I explore topics I want to know more about. I explore areas that I want to become more familiar with. If it so happens that others have similar interests and questions, then great, we have a connection through our shared interest. That's how the niche communities on the Internet work. In 2018, I want to align myself with who I authentically am in ways like I've never done before.
