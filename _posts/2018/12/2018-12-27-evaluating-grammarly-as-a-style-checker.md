trying to get rid of typos

grammarly blocked at my work
much more informative for narrative, conceptual explanations
not sure if advanced features worth it -- variety kind of useless in tech comm contexts
usually flags at least one error per page. almost impossible to see.
editing is so tedious -- i thrive on creativity. editing is not creativity.
best approach to editing is to edit your previous night's work before beginning anew
writers have very little forgiveness for typos, though i think that's a lower-level fixation
