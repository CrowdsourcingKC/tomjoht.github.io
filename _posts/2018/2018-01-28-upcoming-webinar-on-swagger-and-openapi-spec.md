## Presentation description

Here's the presentation description:

>## Swagger UI and the OpenAPI specification
>
> OpenAPI is a specification for describing REST APIs. As an analogy, you can think of the OpenAPI specification like the specification for DITA. With DITA, there are specific XML elements used to define help components, and a required order and hierarchy to those elements. Different tools can read DITA and build out a documentation website from the information.
>
> With OpenAPI, instead of XML, you have set of JSON objects, with a specific schema that defines their naming, order, and contents. This JSON file describes each part of your REST API (the endpoints, parameters, responses, etc). By describing your API in a standard format, publishing tools can programmatically ingest the information and process it.
>
> Swagger UI provides one option to read the OpenAPI specification document and generate an interactive documentation website from it. Interactive documentation created with Swagger lets users try out requests and see actual responses directly from within the documentation.
