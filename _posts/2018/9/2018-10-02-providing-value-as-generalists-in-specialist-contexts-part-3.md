summary: "Because content in the developer domain is so technical and specialized, many developers are collaborating and assisting with the documentation. As developers get involved in docs, they usually adopt docs-as-code tools, writing in simpler Markdown files. Based on these gaps, certain trends open up where technical writers can add value."

## Why developers are writing more docs

So far I’ve argued that complexity has shifted more behind the scenes, in the area of engineering, and that’s where tech writers now focus. But this is not an easy domain for tech writers because tech writers are usually _generalists_.

Navigating the developer domain often requires an engineering level of knowledge. The information is so technical and specialized, tech writers (who are generalists) will have a hard time developing the content. The scenario where a technical writer can become a SME who understands the product with the same depth as the engineers is no longer common.

Because the needed documentation in the developer domain is so highly specialized, another huge trend is occurring: more engineers are writing or contributing to documentation.

## The growth of Write the Docs

As evidence, just look at the emergence and growth of the [Write the Docs](http://www.writethedocs.org/) groups. This group started out, in part, as engineers who write docs looking to connect and help other engineers writing docs. And this group has taken off in tremendous ways over the past few years.

<figure><a href="http://www.writethedocs.org/"><img src="/images/writethedocshomepage.png"/></a><figcaption>Write the Docs was founded mainly by developers who were writing documentation and wanted more community</figcaption></figure>

In fact, Write the Docs, [started in 2013](https://www.writethedocs.org/origin-story/), now has yearly conferences on 3 continents, meetups in 30 cities, thousands in the Slack channel, and more. The group’s focus is on software documentation, not specifically developer docs but that’s a lot of the presentations and members tend to focus on. Some spinoff groups, [API the Docs](https://apithedocs.org/) and [Test the Docs](https://testthedocs.org/), are even more focused on developer docs. The only reason such a developer-centric tech writing community would flourish today is because tech comm has undergone a major evolution from end-users to developers as the target audience.

When you’re documenting systems for mainstream users rather than developers, tech writers can often amass a level of knowledge that makes them capable to write docs almost entirely on their own. But with developer docs and more complex products, it’s often beyond the capacity for tech writers to achieve this level of knowledge without full immersion in the system and more familiarity with programming languages, frameworks, and technologies on a deeper level. That deeper level of knowledge doesn’t come about without getting elbow-deep in code all day.

## Shifts toward Markdown and docs-as-code

There has been a huge shift in tools in the last decade, much in part due to having specialists such as engineers writing and collaborating with docs. Much of the tech comm industry has shifted from XML to Markdown and [docs as code tools](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/pubapis_docs_as_code.html), because most [developers find XML too cumbersome or tedious](https://idratherbewriting.com/2014/09/30/why-developers-will-never-adopt-dita/), and Markdown so easy.

The shift toward simpler documentation formats is only one indicator of a deeper trend: When specialists engage in documentation authoring and publishing, they prefer to remain in their own specialization bubbles and won’t necessarily embrace anything sophisticated with authoring or publishing. So you might end up with a Markdown document or a Word document or wiki page and nothing more.

## Where the gaps open up in developer-author scenarios

This is the scenario where we find ourselves in: We are generalists suddenly surrounded in a context of specialization. How do we prove our value? How do we avoid becoming second-class citizens in developer organizations?

I think that in these specialist contexts, certain gaps open up. Technical writers can focus on these gaps to provide their value. When specialists start writing docs, at least three gaps open up:

(1) Authoring/publishing processes and tools
(2) Knowledge/feedback about the user experience
(3) Information usability and design

Let’s start diving into these gaps. I’ll focus most of my discussion on the last bullet point, but these other two are worth noting.
