This past year, [Cherryleaf](https://cherryleaf.podbean.com) has developed its voice in the tech comm space through podcasts. I've tweeted about a few episodes previously, and I find Ellis has a natural talent for the podcast medium. In his latest podcast, [The one about podcasts](https://cherryleaf.podbean.com/e/43-the-one-about-podcasts/), he lists all the tech comm podcasts plus a few others he listens to. Go to Cherryleaf for the full list.

I'd like to note a few details about podcasts that I think are worth mentioning. First, it seems like podcasts have made a comeback recently. I'm not entirely sure why (it could be that people are so tired of political news that they want to escape into niche topics instead). But podcasts seem to be here to stay.

Additionally, I think too many people underestimate the connection power of a podcast. When someone listens to a podcast, it's like allowing someone to whisper into your ear for a half hour or more. Well, not whispering. But it's a much more intimate experience than reading a blog post. The person's personality, enthusiasm, and other characteristics come through with voice in unmistakable ways.

One problem with podcasts is that because listeners aren't usually sitting at their computers, providing feedback is more difficult. I'd like to get some general feedback about podcasts through a short survey embedded below. *You view the responses to the survey [here](https://www.questionpro.com/t/PEOsYZcwS7)*.
