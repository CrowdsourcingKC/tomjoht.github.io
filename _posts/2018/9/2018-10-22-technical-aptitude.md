After I gave my [second presentation on trends](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/10/09/tech-comm-trends-more-collaboration-with-engineers/), some of the attendees felt like I left the dilemma between being a specialist or a generalist unresolved. Some said, so, should I be a specialist or a generalist, and if I specialize, what should I focus on?

Others were incensed that I wasn't considering language expertise to count as specialized knowledge. I knew this was a controversial subject, and I would no doubt anger people off because to suggest that their writing expertise doesn't count as specialized knowledge in the same light as engineering specializations.

So there are a few loose ends that I'd like to resolve in this trends presentation before I give it again. Overall, in the Q&A after my session, attendees seemed to come to the conclusion that technical acuity more than specific knowledge was more important.

Why? Well, specialized knowledge in a particularly needed subject domain is often difficult to find in candidates. For example, suppose you really want a tech writer who knows Android. Well, try as you might, there are so many different knowledge domains out there, the chances that the technical expertise in your candidate would align squarely with your needs is pretty unlikely.

Instead, attendees seemed to agree that rather than specialized knowledge, what you really need is *technical acuity*, or technical aptitude. In other words, you might not know Android, but your in-depth knowledge of Python and, say, big data analysis might have prepared you with the technical mindset needed to grok the tech you do need to know about Android.

This isn't a hard argument for us to believe. This is the same argument tech writers have been making around tools for ages. You know, we're all coached to answer job interview questions this way &mdash; "I might not know AuthorIt, but I know RoboHelp and Visio, so I'm pretty sure I can pick up AuthorIt quickly."

Strangely, we don't always accept the same arguments about writing. What if a candidate were to say, well, I don't know the details around technical writing formats, but I've written several plays. Or, I've never done technical writing before, but I was once the poet laureate of my town! Or more practically, I haven't done grant writing before, but I've done plenty of technical writing.

Why shouldn't writing in one category transfer to other categories? After all, aren't we addressing a similar rhetorical situation in these other writing situations? Aren't we negotiating our language strategies around considerations of audience and purpose? Isn't this "writing acuity"? If so, why aren't we a bit more flexible on transferable writing skills from one writing domain to another?

Coming back to specialized knowledge versus technical acuity, what do we mean by this? Someone with specialized knowledge might know Python, but someone with technical acuity possesses a "technical mindset." He or she might have an inclination to look at system inputs and outputs, at algorithms that drive application logic, or maybe he or she has a systematic patience for troubleshooting by comparing working code against broken code in a line-by-line fashion, or other troubleshooting strategies.

The same might be said of writing knowledge as well. We don't care if one is an excellent grant writer, but rather we want to know if they can analyze their audience's information needs, whether they can identify the genre discourse and rules and write within that construct. We want to know if they can anticipate the audience's objections and have a conversation (real or imagined) with the audience in order to drive the content. Understanding of rhetoric is basically writing acuity.

Sure, someone might have good rhythm in their sentences and a solid grasp of grammar, but that's not necessarily writing acuity, in the same sense that understanding "for" loops and spacing syntax might not constitute technical acuity.

This discussion takes me back to one of my first technical writing jobs. It was for a documentation job for a networking engineering subject. The hiring engineering basically wanted to know whether I was "technical." I felt I was pretty technical, though as the weeks on the job went by, I realized that I wasn't as technical as the engineer had hoped. I scrambled to become more technical, as I read books on networking engineering and such in an effort to understand what I needed to document in this multi-million dollar storage array.

The question, "Are you technical?" seems like a good question. But it can be interpreted in so many ways. What if I can diagram sentences using advanced grammar terminology? Is that technical? What if I can dis-assemble my bike's crankshaft and then re-assemble it with all new parts? How about if I can swap in new RAM in my computer? Does being technical in one category automatically transfer to technical abilities in other categories?

To an extent, sure. But I think the technical mindset is only the beginning. One has to apply that mindset to study and learning for the subject knowledge needed in that new domain.
