I covered a lot of ground in this essay. I argued the following:

* Technology is becoming increasingly specialized, particularly with developer documentation.
* Since tech writers are generalists, the task of documenting specialized technology often becomes daunting if not impossible.
* To provide value in specialist contexts, tech writers can focus on (1) authoring/publishing processes and tools, (2) knowledge and feedback about the user experience, and (3) principles for information usability and design.

In the principles for information usability, I covered 7 principles in depth:

* Principle: Let users switch between macro and micro views
* Principle: Make information discoverable as the user needs it
* Principle: Ensure information harmony in the larger landscape
* Principle: Reduce and distill vast information down to its essence
* Principle: Conform to the patterns and expectations of the genre and schemas
* Principle: Reduce the complexity of technical language
* Principle: Iterate and increment on content following an agile approach

I list some additional information usability principles on my site, [idratherbewriting.com/simplifying-copmlexity](https://idratherbewriting.com/simplifying-copmlexity), and I'll continue to add to them in the future.

I also included a number of surveys throughout this essay to gather your feedback and input about whether your agree/disagree, and to what extent. I highly value the insights from readers and think that the perspectives shared as a whole can often provide guidance in lack of more rigorous studies or data.

Overall, by focusing on these areas, we can hopefully move past some of the second-class feelings that we sometimes get when surrounded by specialists who seem to possess deep knowledge and value to organizations. If you do all of these things, you'll surely contribute in significant, valuable ways to your organization. But will your company recognize it and value your role and contributions? Proving that value is not easy, but by articulating the specific ways that we add value can help orient us toward the right direction to make the arguments.
