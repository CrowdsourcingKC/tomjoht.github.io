I've been slowly arriving at a sad conclusion: writing is no longer a marketable skill. Or at least it doesn't seem to be. Let me list a few recent events that made me think this way, and then I'll provide a few ideas toward a solution.

It started as I was looking at my site metrics for my two sub-projects: [API documentation](/learnapidoc/) and [Simplifying Complexity](/simplifying-complexity).

The traffic on my Simplifying Complexity site is only about 1.73% of the overall traffic on my site. Here's the stats for the past 3 months:

In contrast, the traffic on my API documentation site is about 60% of my site's overall traffic:

<img src="/images/learnapidoc-stats-graph.png" alt="Traffic on API doc site"/>

How do interpret this? People search for information about skills they lack. While API documentation involves writing, it is a clearly packaged "skill."

Further, I'm guessing that most of the traffic to that API doc site involves developers looking for tips on how to document their API, not technical writers. This is because the traffic is outpacing my regular traffic from my audience. I mean, this past month my site averaged about 4,150 unique page views per day.

4,150 is about 6x the number of people who attend the STC Summit, about 10x the number who attend WTD, and even more than attend tekom in Germany. I really doubt the traffic consists of technical writers. In fact, I think I've met nearly half of all technical writers in person!

Further, few people read the Simplifying Complexity series because tech writers probably already feel confident in this topic, and non-writers don't really feel a need to learn to write, because presumably they already know how to write.

I get regular requests to teach workshops and even classes on API documentation, but almost nothing on simplifying complexity. In fact, if I were to try to package up the content I have so far about simplifying complexity, I'm not even sure how I would market it. Workshops seem geared towards teaching specific skills that can be packaged and sold. Writing (including technical writing) doesn't seem to be a skill that fits into that category.

In fact, my role seems to be catering more and more to groups who write their own documentation. I just edit and publish it. I support a lot of different product groups at my current work, and I only write docs from scratch for some. For other teams, I'm merely a conduit that helps them publish, because I simply don't have the bandwidth to do any more than that.

Today we actually posted a job for a full-time [technical writer/editor](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/700205/technical-writer-editor-alexa-skills) whose job would be helping edit and publish content for product teams who bring their own docs to the table. Here's an excerpt of the position:

> As a technical writer/editor, you'll work with the tech writers and the technical teams to create and drive quality standards and edit and produce the developer documentation in a cross-functional, distributed environment. You'll drive editorial process to ensure a high-quality experience for developers. You'll also serve as the writer and quality control on projects where partner teams are onboarded to publish to the developer portal.

If organizations won't hire enough writers to enable them to actually write documentation (because they're spread so thin), it seems this new role of editor/publisher is what many positions are moving towards. This cheapens the writer's role even more, because now when you do have a technical writer, the person doesn't have enough bandwidth to actually write original content, so it appears that writing has been removed from that person's skillset.

The latest version of the Cherryleaf podcast, [The evolution of the technical communicator’s career](https://cherryleaf.podbean.com/e/the-evolution-of-technical-communication/), also discussed this dreary article [Software technical writing is a dying career (but here's what writers can do to stay in the software game)](https://softwaresaltmines.com/2015/06/16/software-technical-writing-dying/), by Jim Grey published in 2015. Grey's main argument is that

> companies are leaning into good user-interface design and stepping away from online Help systems and printed/PDF documentation.

Grey transitioned into testing instead. In the Cherryleaf podcast, Ellis looks at job trends to conclude that no, technical writing jobs haven't gone away. If you look at the STC Salary Survey you can see that tech writer jobs have largely remained flat:

The report explains:

> Continued growth of employment is a key indicator of the health of an occupation. During 2016, there were an estimated 49,780 technical writers employed in the United States. The
profession was relatively flat, in terms of employment, increasing only 10 jobs versus 2015. However, the employment level in 2016 represents the highest employment level for the
occupation since being individually tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2013 and 2014, there was an estimated increase of 1,140 and 910 technical writer positions,
respectively. This represented a 2.5% increase in 2013 and a 1.9% increase in 2014. During 2015, the profession experienced an increase of employment of 1,560 technical writers,
equating to growth of 3.2% versus 2014. The graph below shows the employment trends of technical writers versus other media and communication occupations. Of this group,
“technical writers” is the only occupation which has seen employment growth in each year since 2011, with an average annual employment increase of 1.9%.

Have technology jobs outpaced the growth of tech writing jobs? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job *growth rate* (different from the total percentage of jobs) for [software developers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) from 2016 to 2026 is 24% ("much faster than average"), while the average for all jobs is just 7%. The job growth for [technical writers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/technical-writers.htm) is 11% (which is still "faster than average.")

How about technology jobs overall? According to Pew Research Center, in 1997 tech jobs made up 1.9% of total jobs. Data collected from 2009-2012 indicate tech jobs make up about 3% of the total jobs ([How U.S. tech-sector jobs have grown, changed in 15 years](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/12/how-u-s-tech-sector-jobs-have-grown-changed-in-15-years/)). An article in USA Today puts tech jobs in 2015 at 6.7% of total jobs, and for 2016 at 6.9% of total jobs ([Tech jobs are thriving nationwide -- up to 7.3M](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm)).

I'm not going to dive into more numbers here, as I'm quickly getting out of my depth. But it's pretty clear looking at the ballpark estimate that if software engineering jobs are growing at more than twice the rate of technical writing jobs, then the ratio of engineers to tech writers is shrinking. This would explain why more engineers are writing docs, and why tech writers are playing more of an editor/publisher role.

Despite so many engineers writing, engineers still hate to write. Matt Asay explains that the most recent GitHub Survey found that even though documentation in open source projects is abysmal, developers are extremely reluctant to write docs:

> 93% of respondents gnashed their teeth over shoddy documentation but also admitted to doing virtually nothing to improve the situation. … If you think this deeply felt need for documentation would motivate more developers to pitch in and help, you’d be wrong: 60% of developers can’t be bothered to contribute documentation. ([Open source documentation is bad, but proprietary software is worse](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_find_open_source_project.html))

All right, so enough of those dismal numbers. So the profession is changing/evolving. Tech writer jobs may not be shrinking, but they're not growing at the same rate as engineering jobs, and as a result many engineers are writing instead. How can we pivot our profession's marketing so that we're not selling our skill as "writing," which is a skill engineers and others already feel they have? What skill do technical writers bring to the table that they can package and sell? *That is the question!*

Before diving into some alternatives, let me first note that I adamantly do believe that writing is a skill. And most writing from engineers (in my experience) is extremely poor. I'm also a firm believer that even among technical writers, there's a wide variety in writing skill. That's what I hoped to capture in some of my Simplifying Complexity essays. But alas, all writing, it seems, doesn't sell on its own.

What sells? To think about this topic, consider what you could package into a workshop and market to people. This is a good way of marketing a skill. Here are some possibilities:

* API documentation
* Video tutorials
* Search engine optimization
* Content strategy
* Usability
* UX copywriting
* Docs-as-code tools
* Programming writing
* Structured authoring / DITA
* Web design  
* Localization
* Chatbots
* Illustration and graphic design
* Project manager / scrum master
* Social media
* Editor
* Customer experience
* Support
