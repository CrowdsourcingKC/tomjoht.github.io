I've been slowly arriving at a sad conclusion: writing is no longer a marketable skill. Or at least it doesn't seem to be. Let me list a few recent events that made me think this way, and then I'll provide a few ideas toward a solution.

It started as I was looking at my site metrics for my two sub-projects: [API documentation](/learnapidoc/) and [Simplifying Complexity](/simplifying-complexity).

The traffic on my Simplifying Complexity site is only about 1.73% of the overall traffic on my site. Here's the stats for the past 3 months:

In contrast, the traffic on my API documentation site is about 60% of my site's overall traffic:

<img src="/images/learnapidoc-stats-graph.png" alt="Traffic on API doc site"/>

How do you interpret this disparity in traffic except to conclude that one type of content is sought more than the other type? Granted, the API doc site has more pages (96 instead of 11) and it's been around longer, and I've given lots of API doc presentations referring to it. But I think it's more than that. People seek to learn about skills *they lack*. While API documentation involves writing, it is a clearly packaged "skill" that many lack.

Few people read the Simplifying Complexity series because tech writers probably already feel confident in this topic, and non-writers don't really feel a need to learn to write, because presumably they already know how to write as well. (At least this is my guess.)

Further, I'm guessing that most of the traffic to that API doc site involves developers looking for tips on how to document their API, not technical writers. This is because the traffic is outpacing the regular traffic on my blog. I mean, this past month my site averaged about 4,150 unique page views *per day*.

<img src="/images/pageviewspermonthwow.png alt="Page views in the past month averaged 4,150 unique page views" />

4,150 is about 6x the number of people who attend the STC Summit, about 10x the number who attend WTD, and even more than attend tekom in Germany. I really doubt all this traffic consists of technical writers. The STC Salary Survey estimates there are only about 50,000 tech writers in the U.S., so to think that about 8% of all U.S. tech writers are visiting my site each day is kind of absurd. (My colleague sits right next to me all day, and I know he doesn't read my posts -- go figure.)

I get regular requests to teach workshops and even classes on API documentation, but almost nothing on simplifying complexity. In fact, if I were to try to package up the content I have so far about simplifying complexity, I'm not even sure how I would market it. Workshops seem geared towards teaching specific skills that can be packaged and sold. Simplifying complexity doesn't seem to be a skill that fits into that category. If you look at the workshops provided at conferences, most are focused around specific skills.

For example, I was looking at some recent workshops at the STC Summit, Lavacon, and other conferences. Here are the titles:

* Structured Authoring and DITA
* Usability and User Experience
* Content Strategy, Engineering, and Management
* CSS Like a Pro
* Content Experience Modeling
* Developing Web Apps
* WordPress for Technical Communicators
* Content engineering
* Technical Writing for Translation
* Context for Content? It Depends.
* Managing Content Development Teams: Inner Mastery
* Machine Learning 101: Get Started with Chatbots
* Design Thinking Workshop
* Experience-Focused Content Organization
* Unified Content Portals
* Learn how to Git
* Content Strategies

Writing is rarely the focus of any workshop. Why? Because writing isn't perceived as a skill (that anyone lacks). Is Simplifying Complexity a skill? Not sure. If so, I would need to structure some kind of analytical framework for the task that packages and presents it as a skill. Like some kind of problem-solving methodology. (Yeah, I could give it a catchy name, and then trademark it! Not.)

Let's shift gears. At work, sometimes my role seems to be catering more to groups who write their own documentation. For some groups, I just edit and publish their content. I support a lot of different product groups at my current work, and I only write docs from scratch for some. For other teams, I'm merely a conduit that helps them publish, because I simply don't have the bandwidth to do any more than that. I mean, right now we have just 2 writers for an entire Appstore.

Another team just posted a job for a full-time [technical writer/editor](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/700205/technical-writer-editor-alexa-skills) whose job would be helping edit and publish content for product teams who bring their own docs to the table. This position will help teams who bring their own docs to the table, so to speak. The writer will help edit and publish the content, rather than write it for them. The writer is more of a facilitor.

The latest version of the Cherryleaf podcast, [The evolution of the technical communicator’s career](https://cherryleaf.podbean.com/e/the-evolution-of-technical-communication/), discussed a dreary article called [Software technical writing is a dying career (but here's what writers can do to stay in the software game)](https://softwaresaltmines.com/2015/06/16/software-technical-writing-dying/), by Jim Grey published in 2015. Grey's main argument is that

> companies are leaning into good user-interface design and stepping away from online Help systems and printed/PDF documentation.

Grey transitioned into software testing instead, leveraging many of the skills he developed as a technical writer. In the Cherryleaf podcast, Ellis looks at job trends and concludes that no, technical writing jobs haven't gone away.

In fact, if you look at the STC Salary Survey you can see that tech writer jobs have largely remained the same:

<img src="/images/techwriterjobsovertime.png" alt="technical writing job growth over the past 5 years" />

The survey explains:

> During 2016, there were an estimated 49,780 technical writers employed in the United States. The
profession was relatively flat, in terms of employment, increasing only 10 jobs versus 2015. However, the employment level in 2016 represents the highest employment level for the
occupation since being individually tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2013 and 2014, there was an estimated increase of 1,140 and 910 technical writer positions,
respectively. This represented a 2.5% increase in 2013 and a 1.9% increase in 2014. During 2015, the profession experienced an increase of employment of 1,560 technical writers,
equating to growth of 3.2% versus 2014. The graph below shows the employment trends of technical writers versus other media and communication occupations. Of this group,
“technical writers” is the only occupation which has seen employment growth in each year since 2011, with an average annual employment increase of 1.9%.

Have technology jobs outpaced the growth of tech writing jobs? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job *growth rate* (different from the total percentage of jobs) for [software developers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) from 2016 to 2026 is projected at 24% ("much faster than average"), while the average for all jobs is projected at just 7%. The job growth for [technical writers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/technical-writers.htm) is projected at 11% (which is still "faster than average.") Still, the fact that the growth rate for engineering jobs is 3x that of tech writing jobs suggests that the ratio of tech writers to engineers is shrinking.

If you support 5 engineering teams now, in 2026 you'll support 15 engineering teams. Think you'll have the bandwidth to write documentation for 15 engineering teams? Probably not unless you're superman. Instead, the tech writer's role might evolve more toward editing and publishing.

How about the growth of technology jobs overall? According to Pew Research Center, in 1997 technology jobs made up 1.9% of total jobs. Data collected from 2009-2012 indicate that technology jobs made up about 3% of the total jobs ([How U.S. tech-sector jobs have grown, changed in 15 years](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/12/how-u-s-tech-sector-jobs-have-grown-changed-in-15-years/)). An article in *USA Today* puts technology jobs in 2015 at 6.7% of total jobs, and for 2016 at 6.9% of total jobs ([Tech jobs are thriving nationwide -- up to 7.3M](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm)).

I'm not going to dive into more numbers here, as I'm quickly getting out of my depth. Also, I only browsed these sources cursorily rather than diving deep, because I just wanted a ballpark estimate. It seems pretty clear that if software engineering jobs are growing faster than technical writing jobs, then even though technical writer jobs aren't technically shrinking, they are shrinking in their comparison to engineering jobs. This would explain why more engineers are writing docs, and why tech writers are playing more of an editor/publisher role.

Despite the trend of so many engineers writing, engineers still hate to write. Matt Asay explains that the 2018 GitHub Survey confirms this &mdash; even though documentation in open source projects is abysmal, developers are extremely reluctant to write docs:

> 93% of respondents gnashed their teeth over shoddy documentation but also admitted to doing virtually nothing to improve the situation. … If you think this deeply felt need for documentation would motivate more developers to pitch in and help, you’d be wrong: 60% of developers can’t be bothered to contribute documentation. ([Open source documentation is bad, but proprietary software is worse](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_find_open_source_project.html))

So even if engineers are writing, they are gnashing their teeth while doing it, and resenting it. As such, what they produce can't be very exciting to read. If it's like most engineering writing I read, it's written with about the same haste and care as an email that is quickly typed, not proofread even once, and immediately sent.

All right, so enough of those dismal numbers. So the profession is changing/evolving. Tech writer jobs may not be shrinking, but they're not growing at the same rate as engineering jobs, and as a result many engineers are writing instead. How can we pivot our profession's marketing so that we're not selling our skill as "writing," which is a skill engineers and others already feel they have? What skill do technical writers bring to the table that they can package and sell? *That is the question.*

Before diving into some alternatives, let me first note that I adamantly do believe that writing is a skill. And most writing from engineers (in my experience) is extremely poor. I'm also a firm believer that even among technical writers, there's a wide variety in writing abilities. That's what I hoped to capture in some of my Simplifying Complexity essays. But alas, all writing, it seems, doesn't sell on its own.

What sells? Earlier I said to consider what you could package into a workshop and market to people. This is a good way of packaging up a skill. You could also look to make your role a hybrid role, as [Jack Molisani noted in an interview](https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/05/19/stc-conference-jack-molisani-on-trends-in-technical-communication/) years ago. Here are a few hyphenated or hybrid roles for technical writers:

* Technical writer/programmer
* Technical writer/video producer
* Technical writer/digital marketer
* Technical writer/content strategist
* Technical writer/usability specialist
* Technical writer/UX copywriter
* Technical writer/publishing tools expert
* Technical writer/DITA expert
* Technical writer/information architect
* Technical writer/illustrator
* Technical writer/localization manager
* Technical writer/web designer
* Technical writer/graphic designer
* Technical writer/content marketer
* Technical writer/editor
* Technical writer/project manager
* Technical writer/web developer
* Technical writer/customer experience professional
* Technical writer/foosball player
* Technical writer/digital storyteller
* Technical writer/corporate communications
* Technical writer/blogger
* Technical writer/communication designer
* Technical writer/plain language expert
* Technical writer/health communicator
* Technical writer/web analytics and SEO
* Technical writer/brand influencer

Here's the problem with "writing." Writing is a *means to an end*. Think of writing like talking on the phone. Sure, some people are great on the phone, and others are terrible. But you don't list your phone skills unless you're applying for a telemarketing job. For better or worse, you use the phone (when you have to) to achieve some end. But you don't promote your skill as a phone talker. Same with writing. Writing has become a skill that everyone assumes we all possess. So you can't really distinguish yourself in a marketable way by promoting yourself as a writer, even if you preface it with "technical" writer.

What do you call the focus on simplifying complexity? This is probably information usability or communication design.

Like I said, this topic just doesn't sell. That's not to say that a deep dive into the ways we simplify complex information couldn't extremely useful and valuable. But it needs to be packaged up as some kind of skill that is separate from writing.

This post has made me think about how I want to hyphenate and sell my own skills independent of writing. Looking at the above list, one jumps out at me as the obvious choice: technical writer/blogger.
