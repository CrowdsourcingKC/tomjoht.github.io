Lately I've been thinking about our throwaway culture, and when to choose buying a new version instead of repairing the broken one. I'm not really thinking about physical goods, but let's start there.

Today, thanks to the "planned obsolescence" model that companies follow, we've grown accustomed to throwing things away when products break, even if it's just a minor issue with an otherwise good product. Repairing broken products is often harder than simply buying new ones. Gaia Vince explains,

> This way of selling more products by designing products that deliberately fail, cannot be repaired, or have a set lifespan imposed in some other way is known as planned obsolescence. ([The High Cost of our Throwaway Culture](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20121129-the-cost-of-our-throwaway-culture))

Think of your light bulbs. These can last hundreds of thousands of hours, but companies build them to burn out after a number of months and be replaced.

Although this throwaway mentality typically applies to our physical goods, how do we avoid not applying the same mentality to everything around us -- our jobs, relationships, friends, lifestyles, studies, and more? Is there a danger of incorporating a throwaway mentality into the rest of our lives?

For example, if your job has some aspects that you consider "broken," does our throwaway culture encourage us to throw the job away and get a new one? If we run into a rough patch in a relationship, do we decide to throw it away and start with a new one? If we find your ability to pursue some hobby is hampered by challenges, do we throw the hobby away?

I was reflecting on job goals the other week (as part of a regular review), and I decided to list out every process, system, or other job-related aspect that I felt was broken and set about trying to fix it. What's broken? Well, "broken" might be too strong of a characterization, but some processes that could be improved include documentation ownership for certain products, synchronization with other groups such as Marketing and Support, the susceptibility of our tools to git catastrophes or page outages, and more.

In my 20 years of working in the corporate world, I've learned that every job has aspects that are broken. That's usually the reason the company hired you &mdash; to fix these broken aspects. All too often, I think we let broken processes and issues persist, which only results in increasing negativity and resentment among teams. But what if, instead of living with broken processes, or waiting to just get into a new situation, we were to meticulously identify every process we felt was broken and then set about systematically trying to fix it?

Some processes are easier to fix than others, for sure. For example, figuring out how to increase awareness of your team in a large company is easier than figuring out how to get senior leaders to champion docs and increase headcount across tech writers.

Still, I think our goals should be rooted in fixing what we perceive to be broken. And perhaps if we determine that a process can't be fixed, at that point we throw it away and get a new one, whatever that might look like. But distinguishing between repair and replace can't be done easily, without first attempting to repair.
