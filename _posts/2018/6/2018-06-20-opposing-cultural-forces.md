Lately I've been thinking about our throwaway culture, and when to choose buying/getting a new version of something instead of repairing the broken one. I'm not really thinking about physical goods, but let's start there.

Thanks to the "planned obsolescence" model that companies follow, where products are designed to last only a certain duration, we've grown accustomed to throwing things away when products break, even if it's just a minor issue with an otherwise good product. Companies deliberately make repairing broken products harder than simply buying new ones. Gaia Vince explains,

> This way of selling more products by designing products that deliberately fail, cannot be repaired, or have a set lifespan imposed in some other way is known as planned obsolescence. ([The High Cost of our Throwaway Culture](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20121129-the-cost-of-our-throwaway-culture))

Think of your light bulbs. These *can* last hundreds of thousands of hours, but companies build them to burn out after a number of months so you have to replace them.

Or think of Macbook Pro laptops, where the memory and hard-drive are soldered in and can't be replaced. As newer operating systems require more memory and rich multimedia requires more and more space, the products meet their inevitable end of life &mdash; by design.

Although this throwaway mentality typically applies to our physical goods, how do we avoid not applying the same mentality to everything around us -- our jobs, relationships, friends, lifestyles, studies, and more? Is there a danger of incorporating a throwaway mentality into the rest of our lives?

For example, if your job has some aspects that you consider "broken," does our throwaway culture encourage us to throw the job away and get a new one? If we run into a rough patch in a relationship, do we decide to throw it away and start a new one? If we find our ability to pursue some hobby is hampered by challenges, do we throw the hobby away?

I was reflecting on job goals the other week (as part of a regular review), and I decided to list out every process, system, or other job-related aspect that I felt was broken and then I set about trying to fix it. What's broken? Well, "broken" might be too strong of a word here, but some processes that could be improved include documentation ownership for certain products, synchronization with other groups such as Marketing and Support, the susceptibility of our tools to git catastrophes or page outages, the tediousness of our localization process, and more.

In my 20 years of working in the corporate world, I've learned that every job has aspects that are broken. That's usually the reason the company hires me in the first place &mdash; to fix these aspects that are broken. All too often, I think we let broken processes and issues persist, which only results in increasing negativity and resentment among teams. But what if, instead of living with broken processes, or waiting to just get into a new situation, we were to meticulously identify every process we felt was broken and then set about systematically trying to fix it?

Some processes are easier to fix than others, for sure. For example, figuring out how to increase awareness of your team's services in a large company is easier than figuring out how to get senior leaders to champion docs and increase headcount across tech writing groups. The most common scenario is a broken authoring or publishing process, usually due to some poorly chosen tool or web-based CMS that everyone is stuck with.

I don't know why we let processes remain broken. Most likely, it's because fixing it requires more energy than simply living with it. I'm embarrassed to say that I can't shift into the bottom 3 sprockets on my Trek bike, but it's fine because I rarely use them anyway. I mostly stay in the same gear all the way to work and back. So why fix it? I know that eventually I'll just get a new bike anyway, replacing this one.

Perhaps if we determine that a process can't be fixed, at that point we throw it away and get a new one, whatever that might look like. But distinguishing between repair and replace can't be done easily, without first attempting repair.

I know I've only scratched the surface here, but my intent isn't to dig too deep. I recognize that distinguishing between when to repair versus when to replace is a tricky situation, and in many jobs, relationships, and other areas of life it really might be better to skip attempts at repair and go straight to replace.
