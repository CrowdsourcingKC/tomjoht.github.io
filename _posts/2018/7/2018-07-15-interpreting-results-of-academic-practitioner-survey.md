The results of my academic/practitioner attitude survey is now available. Here is the survey result for practitioner responses:


And here's the result for academic responses:


I started gathering questions for the survey through some open-ended survey questions that invited people to respond ([Two open-ended surveys to gauge practitioner/academic attitudes
](http://idratherbewriting.com/2018/02/06/survey-to-measure-tc-academic-practitioner-attitudes/)).

Using those responses (I received about 30, with *a lot* of feedback to read through), I then formulated (along with an academic working in the background) the questions into a representative list of agree/disagree questions whose responses could be quantitatively summarized. I posted this quantitative survey here: [A short survey to measure academic/practitioner attitudes](http://idratherbewriting.com/2018/07/02/survey-for-academics-and-practitioners/).

The quantitative results of this survey will act as the baseline for later measurements in my larger project about changing attitudes, which I described here: [Conversations Across Academic/Practitioner Spheres](http://idratherbewriting.com/academic-practitioner-project/).

## Interpreting the survey results

Now that the survey results are in, what do we make of them? I invite your interpretation and feedback. In my opinion, the most significant response is the answer to the first question:

> Academics understand the challenges and issues that practitioners face in the workplace.

Practitioners are undecided on this question. They neither agree nor disagree. They simply do not know, because they don't read enough TC academic publications nor do they attend to enough TC academic presentations to know. As a result, their answer to this first question sort of makes their following answers empty.

For example, if you're undecided about whether academics understand the challenges in the practitioner's workspace, how can you agree that academic research is valuable, that practitioners should partner with academics on projects, that academics are preparing the next generate of tech writers to succeed in the workplace, etc?

Consider this analogy. Have you ever had "Rambutan" fruit? Probably not. Now, what would you say to the statement, *Rambutan is a delicious and wholesome fruit.* Without much knowledge or experience of Rambutan, you could neither disagree or agree. You'd just be undecided until you had more information.

Likewise, without knowledge/experience of Rambutan, could you agree or disagree with any of the following:

* People should eat more Rambutan in their diets.
* Rambutan helps advance the the state of health in the body.
* Rambutan can provide an important component of the human diet.
* Eating abundant amounts of Rambutan is worthwhile.
* Including Rambutan with each meal can provide more complete nutrition.

Knowing that Rambutan is in fact a fruit, you might be positively included to softly agree with most of these statements on the sole basis that most fruits are good for you.

In likewise manner, a practitioner with no knowledge of academic research might generally agree that the research is good, based on the assumption that professors hold earn doctorate degrees after years of study and are generally intelligent people. So based on this assumption, sure, academics help advance the field, and practitioners should read their publications, and partner with them on their research, etc. But just as with the Rambutan analogy, the soft optimism is empty without more knowledge and experience of the thing one is agreeing with.

What if it turns out that, after some healthy consumption of Rambutan, you find that while the fruit does have some nutritional value, the toxins on its skin outweigh the nutritional benefits? Well then, all the other responses wouldn't follow such a happy optimism about the good effects of the fruit.

Enough with my Rambutan analogy. I'm just trying to expose our assumptions here.

I do find it troubling that practitioners are undecided about whether academics understand the challenges and issues that practitioners face. We have entire communities of practice sprouting up (e.g., Write the Docs) that have little to no knowledge of any of the research produced by TC academics. Without more of a theoretical foundation, tech writing is reduced to a list of good tips and best practices based on one's own experiences (which tend to be persuasive enough for many practitioners).

Now let's flip to the other side and look at the results from the academic survey. What stands out most to me is the response to this question:

> Industry practitioners (rather than other academics) are the primary audience for research.

Academics are undecided (leaning more towards disagree) on the answer to this question. Notice that the question didn't say that practitioners *should* be the audience for academic research, so maybe academics believe that the current state isn't the ideal or desired state. But is it any surprise that practitioners aren't diving into academic research given that they aren't the audience academics are writing for?

Another question is *should* academic research be geared toward practitioner benefit? TC journal articles do have a section called "Practitioner Takeaways," which suggests that practitioners are a target audience (else what would they "take away"). But taking the survey responses here at their word, even Practitioner Takeaways aren't really intended for practitioners.

If academics aren't writing for practitioners, who are they writing for? It could be that academics like to explore issues of communication and technology purely for its own sake, without any connection to the industry or workplace. Such an independent focus would be justified in philosophy, or literature.

Here's another way to interpret the response. Even without practitioners reading journals, academic research will trickle down into practitioner workspaces on its own. It's like the news &mdash; even if you don't read the news, you still get a sense of what's going on. You hear about it from somewhere (someone circulates it), even if you don't know the source. For example, many users don't read the documentation but the instruction gets to users by way of support agents who *do* read the documentation.

Or more realistically, academics write journal articles because the pressures of tenure prompt them to, and their real audience is the tenure committee. They cannot appease both the tenure committee (which demands academic discourse, detailed methodology, thorough literature reviews, etc.) *and* practitioners (who look for simple and direct information related to their jobs). Thus, just as we all adhere to the power of the paycheck, academics write for their true audience. In this sense, academics simply inhabit another kind of "workplace."

## Conclusion and next steps

The divide between academics and practitioners is a sorry state of affairs, though it's not unique to our discipline. What can we do about it? I'm going to start a project that I'm calling "Conversations with TC academics," or something. Part of the problem, as academics such as Stacey Pigg have pointed out, is that academics and practitioners have different knowledge flows; they operate and interact in different spheres and spaces.

The idea behind my research project is to merge this interaction into a more common space. Over the course of the year, I'm planning to have conversations in the form of Q&A posts, guest posts, podcasts, and other interactions with academics on my site. More than any other site, I'd Rather Be Writing can function as a bridge between academics and practitioners.  

After a year of this campaign of content, which will pull academics and practitioners into the same space, having the same conversations, and hopefully forging partnerships on projects and other interactions, I will administer this same survey and see if we've moved the needle on any questions.

More than just influencing attitudes that each group has the other, ultimately I hope to diminish the width of the divide a bit. I want academics to start undertaking research that is more relevant to practitioners, and I want practitioners to start leveraging academic research to inform decisions. As we influence each other, both groups will benefit and move forward in more effective ways.




Practitioners should read academic research publications (e.g., books, journals, or conference proceedings) or attend conferences or other events where academics present their research.

Research from academics helps advance the field of technical communication.

The research conducted by academics is relevant to practitioners

The research that academics do can guide professional practices in the field.

Partnering with academics on research projects is worthwhile.

Academics who teach students are effectively preparing the next generation of technical writers to succeed in the workplace.
