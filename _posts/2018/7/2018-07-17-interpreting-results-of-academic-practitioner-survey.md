The results of my academic/practitioner attitude survey is now available. Here is the survey result for practitioner responses:


And here's the result for academic responses:


## Background on the survey

I initially started shaping the survey topics by asking some open-ended questions that invited people to respond (see [Two open-ended surveys to gauge practitioner/academic attitudes](http://idratherbewriting.com/2018/02/06/survey-to-measure-tc-academic-practitioner-attitudes/)).

Based on those responses, I received about 30, with *a lot* of feedback to read through. I then formulated (along with an academic partner working in the background) the questions into a representative list of agree/disagree questions whose responses could be quantitatively measured. I posted this quantitative survey here: [A short survey to measure academic/practitioner attitudes](http://idratherbewriting.com/2018/07/02/survey-for-academics-and-practitioners/).

I kept the survey open for 2 weeks and collected 385 practitioner responses and 65 academic responses. As this second survey was a quantitative measure, it gives me a specific number as a baseline to compare later responses to the same questions.

My plan is to start the "conversation" element of my project. I describe this in more detail here: [Academic/Practitioner Conversations](http://idratherbewriting.com/academic-practitioner-project/). The basic idea is to create conversations between practitioners and academics by pulling them both into the same space. (You will see exactly what I mean by this in the upcoming weeks...)

## Interpreting the survey results

Now that the survey results are in, what do we make of the responses? I invite your interpretation and feedback. I feel the most significant response is the answer to the first question:

> Academics understand the challenges and issues that practitioners face in the workplace.

Practitioners are **undecided** on this question. They neither agree nor disagree. They simply do not know, because they don't read enough TC academic publications nor do they attend to enough TC academic presentations to know. As a result, their answer to this first question sort of makes their following answers empty.

For example, if you're undecided about whether academics understand the challenges in the practitioner's workspace, how can you agree that "Practitioners should read academic research publications" or that "Research from academics helps advance the field" or that "The research conducted by academics is relevant" or that "The research that academics do can guide professional practice." it doesn't follow.

Consider this analogy. Have you ever had lychee fruit? Maybe. Now, what would you say to the statement, *lychee fruit is a valuable and beneficial fruit.* Without much knowledge or experience of lychees, you could neither disagree or agree. You'd just be undecided until you had more information.

Without knowledge or experience of lychee fruit, could you agree or disagree with any of the following?

* People should eat more lychees in their diets.
* Lychees helps advance the the state of health in the body.
* Lychees can provide an important component of the human diet.
* Eating abundant amounts of lychee fruit is worthwhile.
* Including lychee fruit with each meal can provide more complete nutrition.

Knowing that lychee fruit is in fact a fruit, you might be positively included to softly agree with most of these statements on the sole basis that most fruits are good for you.

In likewise manner, a practitioner with no knowledge of academic research might generally agree that the research is good, based on the assumption that academics earn doctorate degrees after years of study and are generally intelligent people. So based on this assumption, sure, academics help advance the field, and practitioners should read their publications and partner with them on their research and adhere to their guidelines for professional practices, etc. But just as with the lychee fruit analogy, the soft optimism is empty without more knowledge and experience.

What if it turns out that, after some healthy consumption of lychee fruit, you find that while the fruit does have some nutritional value, unripe lychees have toxins that can cause encephalopathy in children? Well then, all the other responses might not follow such a happy optimism, would they.

Enough with my lychee fruit analogy. I'm just trying to expose some assumptions here.

Let's put aside the question of value from academic research for practitioners. Isn't it a little troubling that practitioners are undecided? It would be better if they either agreed or disagreed &mdash; at least then practitioners would be making a more informed decision. But today we have entire communities of practice sprouting up (e.g., Write the Docs) that have little to no knowledge of any of the research produced by TC academics.

Worst case scenario, without more of a theoretical foundation, tech writing is reduced to a list of good tips and best practices based on one's own experiences (which tend to be persuasive enough for many practitioners). But whether that theoretical foundation that advances tech comm comes out of academic research or not is another question.

Now let's flip to the other side and look at the results from the academic survey. What stands out most to me is the response to this question:

> Industry practitioners (rather than other academics) are the primary audience for research.

Academics are undecided (leaning more towards disagree) on the answer to this question. Notice that the question didn't say that practitioners *should* be the audience for academic research, so maybe academics believe that the current state isn't the ideal or desired state. But is it any surprise that practitioners aren't diving into academic research given that they aren't the audience academics are writing for?

Let's think more about this question and our assumptions. *Should* academic research be designed to benefit practitioners? TC journal articles do have a section called "Practitioner Takeaways," which suggests that practitioners are a target audience (should there also be an "Academic Takeaways" section?). But taking the survey responses here at their word, even Practitioner Takeaways aren't really intended for practitioners.

If academics aren't writing for practitioners, who are they writing for? It could be that academics like to explore issues of communication and technology purely for its own sake, without any connection to the industry or workplace. For example, how does technology impact the way humans communicate with one another in society? Academics might explore these questions independent of any actual application to technical writers in the workplace, let alone something so mundane as software documentation. Such an independent, academic-centric focus would be justified in philosophy, or literature. (In fact, philosophy's connection to anything outside of academia is sometimes questionable.)

Here's another way to interpret the survey response. Even without practitioners reading journals, academic research will trickle down into practitioner workspaces on its own. It's like the news &mdash; even if you don't read or watch the news, you still get a sense of what's going on. You hear about it from somewhere (someone circulates it), even if you don't know the source. Consider how many end-users don't actually read the documentation, but they learn about the right techniques through support agents who *do* read the documentation. Thus, in this model, academics might be writing for other academics without concern for neglecting the practitioner audience. But they can still be writing for practitioners in an indirect way.

More realistically, academics write journal articles because the pressures of tenure prompt them to, and their real audience is the tenure committee. They cannot appease both the tenure committee (which demands academic discourse, scientific methodology, thorough literature reviews, and a grounding in "rhetoric") *and* practitioners (who look for simple and direct information related to their jobs, often preferring more technical and vocational grounding). Thus, just as we all adhere to the power of the paycheck, academics write for their true audience &mdash; other professors who will give them a thumbs up or down on tenure. In this sense, academics simply inhabit another kind of corporate workplace.

## Conclusion and next steps

The divide between academics and practitioners is a sorry state of affairs (though it's not unique to our discipline). What can we do about it? I'm going to start a project that I'm calling [Academic/Practitioner Conversations](http://idratherbewriting.com/academic-practitioner-project/). Part of the problem, as academics such as Stacey Pigg have pointed out (in her article on [Multidirectional Knowledge Flows](https://www.stc.org/techcomm/2016/11/01/toward-multidirectional-knowledge-flows-lessons-from-research-and-publication-practices-of-technical-communication-entrepreneurs/)), is that academics and practitioners have different knowledge flows; they operate and interact in different spheres and spaces. One goes to conferences and reads blogs, the other goes to the library and talks with students in the classroom.

The idea behind my research project is to bring these two groups into a common space where they can interact through conversations. Over the course of the year, I'm planning to have conversations with academics about their articles and research. I invite others to join me as well. These conversations will take the form of Q&A posts, guest posts, podcasts, and perhaps other forms. More than any other site, I'd Rather Be Writing can function as a bridge between academics and practitioners.  

After a year of conversations &mdash; conversations that will hopefully forging partnerships on projects and other interactions &mdash; I will administer this same survey and see if we've moved the needle on any questions.

More than just influencing attitudes that each group has about the other, ultimately I hope to diminish the width of the divide a bit. I want academics to start undertaking research that is more relevant to practitioners, and I want practitioners to start leveraging academic research to inform workplace decisions. As we influence each other, both groups will move forward in more informed ways.
