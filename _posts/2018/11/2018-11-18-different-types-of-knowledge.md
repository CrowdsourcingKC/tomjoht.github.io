## Critical inquiry versus vocational knowledge.

Lately I've been thinking about two types of knowledge: academic knowledge versus vocational knowledge. Or rather, critical inquiry versus vocational how-to. Or intellectual knowledge versus technical knowledge. In short, asking *why* versus asking *how* or *what*. I'm not entirely sure how to characterize the differences, but the difference in focus has contributed to some angst in my tech writing career lately.

Rewind a bit to my previous posts on trends (such as [this one](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/10/09/tech-comm-trends-more-collaboration-with-engineers/) or [the earlier one](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/10/02/providing-value-as-generalists-in-specialist-contexts-part-1/)), and you'll find that I've been wrestling with the question of whether to be a generalist or specialist. Regardless of any generalist/specialist outcomes around research and what employers want, etc., it's hard to escape this one critical fact: you can't write without knowledge. Unless you have a more solid technical grounding, you just can't write about those topics. Consequently, in order to be a rock star technical writer (rather than just a supporting editor/publisher for engineering writers), you have to move into the technical knowledge domain to some extent. Not necessarily a specialist, but you have to accrue more understanding of the subject than a generalist might have.

With this understanding, I decided to sink some dedicated time to just learning tech every day. For a week at work, I decided that I would do 3 [tech pomodoros](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/jobapis_learning_code.html#techniques-for-learning-code) at the start of each day (a pomodoro is a 20 minute session of focused learning &mdash; it's my approach to learning). Given the many interruptions and needed emails to respond to or meetings or fires to extinguish, etc., I often wouldn't finish my 3 tech pomodoros until noon. After a week of this, I found that my productivity plummeted at work. It seemed I wasn't accomplishing nearly the same as what I did previously.

So I decided to put the tech learning on pause for a bit to catch up and make more progress on some high-priority documentation tasks. I threw myself headlong into documenting what was one of the more challenging tasks on my plate. But as much as I tried, I realized that it was an extremely complicated subject, and since the requirements document that engineers gave me as a starting point assumed so much technical knowledge already, the documentation was really slow-going.

It is really hard to write something when you only have a partial knowledge of the technical domain. Presumably, the tech pomodoros I was doing should increase my technical knowledge for the needed documentation, right? Sort of. Or indirectly. I mean, it sounds good in theory but in practice doesn't always match up. The documentation tasks at work require an advanced level of knowledge, which I can't just absorb from google searches or other quick tutorials. I need the e-learning courses that build from ground zero and move through novice, then intermediate, and later to advanced topics.

I could go into details, but it would bore you. In short, as technical writers working in developer documentation, we usually write assuming our users have proficiency in a particular code domain, so we avoid the ground-zero to beginner/novice approach. But as a generalist, this sort of knowledge accumulation and training is exactly what I need.

Which brings me back to my dilemma about being a generalist or specialist. In order to accrue the needed knowledge to be productive in authoring content (or even just editing and structuring it), I need to specialize my knowledge a bit more. Not become a specialist, but I need to know a lot more than I currently do. Trying to write coherently about something I only partially understand is frustrating (though I guess this feeling captures much of the heart of what it's like to be a technical writer).

As [Mark Baker wrote in a comment](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/10/24/technical-aptitude/#comment-4183073744) on my post about [Preferring technical acuity over specialized knowledge
](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/10/24/technical-aptitude), "All professional technical communicators are ... by definition, underqualified for the work they are doing. And it shows ... The best person for each individual job is the one who comes closest the the virtually unattainable combination of rhetorical and technical acuity and knowledge that each individual job requires." In other words, the technical writer is the *least unqualified* person. Like choosing basketball teams and seeing that all options for teammates are weak players who can barely shoot. Finding someone who possesses both the rhetorical skills *and* the technical skills needed to complete these documentation tasks is not easy.

And why are technical writers unqualified? It depends on the level of complexity you're documenting, for sure. But for deeply complicated coding challenges in the developer domain (intended for senior-level engineers), the generalist technical writer's background will come up short. This is why I decided that if I want to both survive and thrive in developer doc environments, I needed to step up my technical game by purposefully and deeply increasing my technical aptitude at the required level. Hence the regiment of tech pomodoros each morning.

The problem and angst, though, is realizing that the sort of technical knowledge I need isn't the kind of knowledge that excites me. I don't find vocational knowledge nearly as exciting as critical inquiry. I'm much more interesting in *why* than *what* questions. Yet the tech learning focuses almost exclusively on *how* knowledge &mdash; how to build things, from an engineering point of view. If restricted to *how* questions, technical writing is more of a sub-discipline under engineering than a focus in the humanities discipline of rhetoric.

## States of mind

A while ago, I conducted a survey on my blog about practitioner and academic collaboration (see [Two open-ended surveys to gauge practitioner/academic attitudes](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/02/06/survey-to-measure-tc-academic-practitioner-attitudes/). One of my questions was this:

> Do you trust advice academics might provide on professional practices, on theories that should guide action, or some other factor? Why or why not?

One of the responses stood out to me, and I'll quote it here:

> For the most part, I’ve trusted advice from academics when it related to research findings; although, they don’t have the same perspective as me because I’m in the real world, and they’re outsiders just talking about a world of which they’re not belonging. For example, an academic told me that graduate school promoted arguments, and graduate students need to learn to disagree. In the real world (aka professional world), arguing with others and disagreeing does not help the business. Instead we need to work together to identify what’s best for the business. As tech writers, we need to find ways to add value, but we don’t need to waste time disagreeing with others to develop “interesting” conversations. That’s not why we’re brought on board. Clearly, that academic’s perspective did not reflect business sense, so I trust their advice, but I know enough to know they could influence me to do something that’s not in my best interest (professionally).

In short, when the survey respondent says "graduate students need to learn to disagree," I think he or she is saying academics invite students to think critically and challenge assumptions. This is the general direction of knowledge in the academia: moving towards openness, asking questions, questioning assumptions, distrusting the motives and agendas, and so forth. It is exactly this kind of critical thinking that I learned to love. It's why I majored in English and later earned an MFA in literary nonfiction writing.

I remember once during my MFA program, I decided to dig as deeply as possible in a topic. I would start at a seemingly trivial point, but start asking questions and more questions and more questions to see how interesting of a direction I could go. At times it was exhilarating to see the different topics and trajectories play out. And then equally challenging to figure out how to present and structure the journey in an essay.

As I taught composition, I came up with a formula for a thesis statement that was guaranteed to work pretty much every time: "Although many people think X, actually Y is the case." This forced students to think in unconventional ways, to value looking from different, less commonly held perspectives and to explore alternatives to the norm.

All too often, I feel like that critical journey is missing from the documentation projects in the workplace. Instead of critical inquiry, that thought journey has already been taken by the engineering group. They have applied their minds to figure out a creative solution to a (sometimes seemingly impossible) technical challenge. They might have evaluated different information system models, different code languages and approaches, and more. When they finish, they feel that the creative solution has been achieved. What's left is merely to document the solution. And that's when they reach out to me &mdash; to come in after the thinking has been done to merely describe the solution.

Here is where technical writing can become very boring as a career. If my only task is to "document the solution," where is the fun in that? Where is the critical journey, the inquiry and the adventure in figuring out the puzzle? Where is my ability to "disagree," as I learned in graduate school? What assumptions can I challenge? How can I interrogate a topic and ask my own questions?

I find these scenarios boring. This mindset makes tech writing a chore and a profession that would be best titled "Engineering Secretary." It's *suffocating* for someone with a creative mind.

## Examining a different *why* and *how*

Well, if that's the extent of a tech comm career, this would be a very short and sad post. However, I believe this short-sells the tech comm profession in significant ways. In reality, technical writers have a problem to solve as well: *how* to communicate very complicated information in easy-to-understand ways. This is a challenge engineers rarely consider, but it should be the foremost challenge that a technical writer considers.

Let's return back to the requirements document I was trying to make sense of earlier. Engineers laid out the basic information users would need to know, and they hoped that I could just run with this information and make it understandable for users to implement. But not only is there a vast difference between a requirements document and user documentation, even as a requirements document, the information was barely readable. Not just poorly worded sentences, but no sense of organization around implementation tasks. Add in jargon, assumptions all over the place, no sense of audience or structure, and you end up with a mess. Lengthy bullet point after bullet point, sub-bullets and sub-sub bullets. It's the kind of document that only makes sense to people who have been meeting for months to discuss the content.

As a technical writer, it's easy for me to forget this more creative component to my job: *figuring out how to present complex information.* Could it be that figuring this conundrum out is just as complex as the technical solution itself? It depends on the degree of complexity behind the information, for sure, but for a really meaty technical implementation, creating the documentation might be a significantly challenging task worthy of its own study and critical inquiry.

Think about how often documentation fails for users. Besides the varying technical backgrounds of users, the jargon in the technical domain, the many permutations and options around configuration, contrasting business goals and such, creating good documentation &mdash; documentation that simplifies what is truly complicated &mdash; can be a real puzzle. This is part of the reason I started a whole series on [Simplifying Complexity](/simplifying-complexity).

Beyond just working with words (and sentences and structure and organization), we also bring to bear our publishing expertise to ideate on the solutions to the problem of simplifying complexity. This is why I also dive into publishing tools and techniques more than most technical writers, and why I can geek out on Jekyll. It's not just that I like authoring tools and publishing workflows. It's because I use authoring and publishing tools in service of my larger goal of simplifying complexity.

For example, in unraveling this documentation challenge I'm currently working on, there are large chunks of code. I realized that it would really be handy to include line numbers in the code so that I could refer to different chunks of code during the conceptual explanations. How do you get line numbers to appear in your code samples? It's not immediately simple. Even GitHub does not support line numbers in code.

I learned how to use the `linenos` parameter with Jekyll's `highlight` tag, but the table-based display was a mess to sort out with CSS, as the line numbers get rendered as a table in the HTML. The PDF version of the line-numbered code with line wraps was a hopeless wash, but the online version worked well enough.

I bring this expertise with the publishing tools and technologies (HTML, CSS, and JS) to assist me in the challenges around simplifying complexity. In fact, I have a whole section on [Hiding Complexity](/simplifying-complexity/hiding-complexity.html) through various techniques in my Simplifying Complexity series.

## Conclusion

In this profession of technical communication, there are many times where I feel my greatest challenge is in learning the technology. It's easy to forget that my role is not merely dictation and transcription, being a kind of secretary for engineers. My role is to figure out *how* to communicate the complexity in the best possible way.

How do I maintain this mindset, so that I don't feel a sense of suffocation about simply documenting solutions but rather be actively engaged in critical thinking and inquiry about the communication problems I'm trying to solve?

Perhaps instead of starting out the day with tech pomodoros, I should focus more on "tech comm pomodoros," as that is the north star for tech comm. Not replacing the tech learning altogether, but more evenly balancing it.
