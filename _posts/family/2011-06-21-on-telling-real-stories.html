<p>All my children are enamored with stories. If you're telling a good story, they will sit patiently for anything. I believe I could brush their teeth for a half hour as long as they were gripped by the story I was telling them.</p>
<p>Tonight I told Callie stories about everything -- how I started the lawnmower, how I got my job in Egypt, how we decided to move to Utah. I told her how Avery was a baby when 9/11 happened, and what 9/11 was all about.</p>
<p>In telling these stories, I realized a certain irony about my blog -- though I'm a prolific blogger, the most important stories, I never write. The real stories, I never tell. I hide behind the mask of professional writing. I hide behind the "safe yet interesting to some other professionals" topics. Meanwhile the stories that matter, that grip my children into a curious, serious trance, that have actual significance for me, I never tell.</p>
<p>This is what this personal blog is all about -- it's about telling the real stories of my life, and the made-up stories as well.</p>
<p>The writing may be sloppy and unstructured. That's okay, as I'm not so much focusing on the ideas as much as the stories.</p>
<p>The stories may be spiritual, or daddy stories, or husband stories. But I promise that they will be the real stories.</p>
