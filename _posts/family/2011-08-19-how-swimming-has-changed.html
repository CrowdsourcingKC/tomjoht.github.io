<p>Shannon is still out at Education Week at nights, so I took the kids swimming last night. The kids absolutely love swimming, but I must admit that swimming has lost some of its appeal for me. As a kid I could jump and dive and swim all over as I wanted. But now as an adult, I mostly hold Molly, and I keep an eye on Lucy. I'm more of a buoy than a fish. It's probably good exercise for the kids, but for me it's an exercise in patience. I prefer to swim when Shannon and I can switch off holding the baby and watching Lucy. Still, it's fun to see the kids having so much fun.</p>
<p>If there's one thing I've realized this week, it's that kids like to be active. It's odd given that kids supposedly watch 6 hours of television a day (not our kids, though). In general, kids would mostly like to be playing -- riding bikes, running in the grass, maneuvering around jungle gyms, swimming, roller skating, exploring new areas, kicking a soccer ball, building forts, racing around gyms, and anything else that involves playful activity. I think if I point my kids toward this direction, they would play in active ways for hours.</p>
<p>The only problem is that this requires a lot of time.</p>
