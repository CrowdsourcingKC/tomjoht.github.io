<p>One of the Girl Scout badges we recently worked on was the Bug badge. This was one of the most fun badges because it involved trapping and observing all kinds of insects. We visited Rancho San Antonio park to make our bug exploration. Here are a few pictures.</p>

<p>Interestingly, when we returned from the park, we found out that we had some bed bugs in Callie and Lucy's room. We ended up disassembling their room, spreading diotomacious earth all around the room, and then attempting to clean it up. We also got protective cases for the mattresses. It took about a week to clean up. We haven't seen bed bugs in there since.</p>
